"i’ve been scammed 5k sorry for any grammatical issues.

short story, i needed money because i am a broke college student, and i sent this guy all my info. i trusted him for a bit, but then he started depositing what i believe counterfeit checks in my account. i called the bank and canceled everything but since i gave out my info the bank won’t refund me. now i am making payments towards the 5k. should i contact ic3? will that make me liable of trying to do fraud as well? 

i am stupid and naive and i’ve learned from my mistake but i don’t want anyone to go through what i did. but i don’t want to be in trouble.... thanks"
"i got scammed-will i be able to get refund? hi,

thanks"

"is this online store legit and safe? hello everyone,

i was looking for some resident evil collectables online and i found one shop that has them for much lower prices.items aren't that expensive,and i wanted to buy 3 items in total.on ebay they cost $24,$26 and $35 plus shipping for each.however in this store they cost $18,$13 and $18.also,it says there's free shipping over $40,and it says shipping under that amount is $25.

i noticed that another item costs $62,but on ebay it costs $130.

store has paypal method of paying,which is good,but here is the problem.that site is only 21days old and don't have any reviews.i started to dig online and i found almost identical store with very slightly different prices and same items,and same everything except name,and that site is also 21 days old.

here are links from stores:

bought a shitty webcam on ebay that doesn't work and the user was banned before i got it i paid $113 for a shitty broken logitech webcam that doesn't work and the user who sold it to me was banned from ebay before i received it. so i don't really know if i can return it because i can't contact them anymore and get the return address and send it back to them. how is the refund going to work? i didn't do it through paypal so i can't do a chargeback. i don't really know what to do now. ebay has shutdown their phone support because of covid-19 so i can't talk to anyone.

"[warning] don't buy anything from kinguin, details inside. i wanted to serve as an example and warn everyone not to purchase anything through their website.

in short, i purchased minecraft from their website for 5ish dollars and they sent me a duplicate key that was already used. i opened a support ticket on their website and after 5 conversations with their support agents over a 2 week period they refused to give me a replacement key or a refund. they instead asked for my minecraft account username/password or to give them remote control over my pc via teamviewer, even after i provided them with screenshots and freshly recorded video clips where i show that the key doesn't work and every other proof that they asked for. 

i must admit that i knew nothing about kinguin before, i am a regular video game customer who likes to purchase games directly from sellers, but in the case of minecraft i had no choice but to try and purchase the game elsewhere because the game is 30$ on minecrafts website.

i don't care about the money that they scammed me for so i'm not salty about that. hope this helps some of you out there who are thinking about buying something from kinguin, i know that some keys work but even then there is always a danger of the game key being fake or used."

"welp they got me so during these weird times i was really wanting a nintendo switch to pass the time. i found one on letgo for $300 and stupidly let my impatience get the better of me.

i allowed the seller to convince me that they'd ship to me as the way they talked sound ""genuine"" and they had asked me to use zelle, which most scammers don't seem to do. for some reason they said they couldn't find me on zelle so we used cashapp instead.

so i sent the money after they gave me a tracking number for the shipment and it's been almost a week with no update to the tracking info and they haven't responded to my emails. 

so an expensive lesson in making sure impulsivity doesn't get the better of me and that if it seems weirdly convenient, then it's probably not legit.

anyway stay safe out there and be smarter than i was."

"decran international investments ltd a.k.a strong current enterprises scam alert! this is a chinese company that markets overpriced crap products like tvbuddy (google chrome knockoff) tv antennas, feverpatrol (a no touch thermometer that they doubled the price on once covid started) mobile klean, usb devices that use backup software sending your data to a chinese owned site.... and a ton of other products..

they use dozens of websites, if you search scam on any of the products, a fake scam review site comes up telling you how great the product is with a link at the bottom to purchase. most claims made by any site of theirs is misleading at best, an outright lie the rest of the time. (exapmle: tbbuddy claims free tv without cable. they never mention it works like google chromecast and you need paid subscriptions to netflix or the like...) all sales websites will offer pop up after pop up offering coupons and up-sell items. the end price is rarely what you were told. 

if you order, don’t expect the product for 3 or more months, if at all. if you actually receive the product, don’t expect it to work/provide the service they advertised/or be as easy to use... 

products refunds are processed about 1/4 of the time they are requested.

"bitrefill warning don't use it, i got a non working card and instead of a solution i was called a liar, scammer, was mocked and trolled by their customer support when the evidence is clear that it was their fault. just check this, it's unbeliavable. thankfully netflix solved it by giving me a courtesy 6 months but i still spread the word so it doesnt happen to anyone else and because to be honest, this deserve to be seen.

it really feel bad to pay 60 dollars, 20 days after and also after many confirmation from netflix that i'm right, being treate like this by customer support. i need to vent it out as this is incredible for me so please read the thread, it would help me to feel better if at least one person is aware of my case.

"the difference between airplane game and a ponzi scheme and what kind is the blessing loom? a ponzi scheme is built upon the model ""rob peter to pay paul"". you get initial investors, keep it, use new investors money to pay back some return to the initial investors and it goes on and on. the point is the main person keeps money and one group of people is losing. you can hold off on people saying ""returns are coming"" when they never are, you dont have to rely on new investors. 

the airplane game is when people in the lowest rank pay the highest rank, when the highest rank caps out, those immediately under him get paid. the game ends when there no one to recruit. when it ends, if you're not at the very top, you have a net loss. 

the current blessing loom is the simplest of the airplane game, it's not a ponzi scheme"

"buying a graphics card online hi,

i'm currently in the market for a gtx 1080ti and have found a potential seller, however, i am sceptical as i cannot inspect the card myself until it arrives due to the travel restrictions with covid-19. the seller has a few reviews on their facebook account and seems to be honest with how he ended up with the card and the reasons why he is selling it, furthermore, he has also said that i can transfer the money via paypal with paypal protection but, i have never sent a large amount of money via paypal and i do not know how easy it would be to claim the money back if the card were to be faulty. having said this, the seller has said that he is willing to exchange the card if it is faulty at no extra cost, so long as it is within a 24 hour period of receiving the card.

in regards to evidence that i had received of the advert being legit, the seller has linked me to his ebay post where he is selling the card on there and has sent me a custom video saying my full name, today's date and shown the card with the box etc.

does anyone have any advice as to how i can protect myself for any potential scams/issues that arise with the purchase of a secondhand graphics card and does anyone have any experience with paypal pay protect and the process i would need to go through/how easy the process is if things were to go wrong. 

any feedback on this situation will be appreciated."

all my machines run the up-to-date os (microsoft) and up-to-date nod32 and are all clean.

all our business emails are collecting in gmail and all our mobile devices are clean too.

all my spf, dkim and dmarc are good

i have no idea how they can spoof the subject of the emails without having access to our emails but is not the case because all our emails are safe with a very strong password and i have checked all of them.

the only vulnerability i see is a valid lts certificate, in fact, every time i try to add a new email to gmail, they notify me that the emails are transmitted insecurely.

any suggestion to help me to fight back?

however, while i don’t really know how winning pch involves, or anything really about it, this doesn’t seem right. as far from what i’ve been told, he got a big safe kinda thing somehow (he didn’t elaborate on it) that supposedly has checks and all kinds of things that, if i understood correctly, they have been having him send off as part of procedure.

i’m fairly certain it’s a scam, and my grandpa even told them to stop calling and all that, and somehow they kept him on the hook, and have managed to convince him by returning calls after a few days / weeks and saying who knows what. i just don’t know what exactly he’s involved in with this box. if anyone has any details i’d appreciate it if you’ve seen or experienced similar."

"was this puppy seller trying to scam me? ok i'm not sure why this has been bugging me but i think i just want to know for my general knowledge.

i posted a ""looking for"" ad on kijiji, pertaining to a small teacup yorkie dog. 

right away i got a text from a number with the area code nothing like i've seen before - i typed into google and it showed ontario.. i'm located in vancouver, bc. i told the seller this, and he said he is from victoria (close to vancouver, just need to take a ferry to get there) and that he is willing to ship to me... but he wanted me to send a $200 deposit via contract. i told him i'm hesitant about this, and he went on to explain this contract legally hold up in court. he told me to google it (gave more details about the legal contract but i deleted the text so i can't recall..)

red flags:

\- all the yorkies i've seen were $1500+.. he was selling them for $700 each. 

\- he didn't have an ad up because ""crazy people messaging him.""

\- declined my request for a facetime call to see puppies/confirm if legit, claims he is old and doesn't know how to facetime but i am free to call him.

\- seller pretended to be a female at first, and then answered the phone claiming to be her ""husband.""

\- called him and said i'm trying to avoid a contract, would be willing to take a ferry to victoria and meet the puppies. he said because of covid and his small grand children he does not want strangers in the house. i said i can meet him down the street, i'm just trying to find ways around the contract and could meet him down the street as either way we would have to meet and he hung up on me said he's ""not trying to argue."" i really wasn't arguing.

he then texted me saying ""i'm the seller, not you."" i said sorry you weren't able to scam me. he then went on to call me immature, and ""undereducated."" 

do you think this guy was the real deal or a scam? i feel bad if i called someone a ""scammer if they weren't, especially cause he got so upset about me saying that to where he was angry, but does this not seem fishy?"

"senior tenant moved into moms house hi, recently my mom let an older man (60's) rent a room in her home. this was all done without my knowledge and now i am staying with her for a few weeks during this covid lockdown. some government agents came over to the house to inspect the house for safety and all that and the checks she got were from ny state so its legit. the rent does not come out of his pocket but comes from a government assistance program called home base in nyc. i looked it up, its some homeless prevention assistance program where they will help him with rent for up to a year. the rent she gets is definitely higher than what a room in this house would be. he isn't very tech savvy and asked me to help him transfer some porn videos from one phone to another very casually. he seems harmless and kinda sickly and fragile but i noticed that he seems to be the type to go on facebook or insta and chat with random women he finds online, usually commenting on their bodies. i couldn't help but notice the massive amount of messages and notification he gets from very obvious scammers. anyway he likes to talk a lot and he told me about his ""girlfriend"" that lives in some other state that doesn't have a lot of money and he completely trusts her and they have met in person. i led the conversation to the topic about all the scams on his phone and he told me this story about his girlfriends sister that tried to get him to cash in a $4000 from some charity and he would get to keep half, and the other half goes to his girlfriend and her sister. luckily he was smart enough to wait and see if the check cleared before he took out any money, but the bank froze his account for fraud when the check bounced. i called him out on this and told him it sounded like a scam, but he completely rationalized it by saying his girlfriend was trying to do the right thing because he sent her some money one time when she had some problems and she was trying to return the favor but the sister is a dumb ass and didn't know the check would bounce. this made me even more sus but i was too uncomfortable to press him further on what seems like an obvious scam because he kept defending his girlfriend and even said he would never give money to anyone he didn't trust blah blah blah and won't put the residence that he's staying at in danger if he didn't completely trust the person. he's mentioned that hes talking with his girlfriend and she is planning to move in with him at the end of the month or something. he even showed me pictures of this girl, and she is young and hot, while this man is old, not very attractive and clearly doesn't have a lot of money. i'm worried now that he's gonna put himself in some vulnerable position where my moms house will be robbed or she will be hurt. the money she gets from this program helps her out a lot and the man himself does not seem like a dangerous person but makes some wild life choices and has even told me a story about how he went to prison for punching a cop when he was younger. do you think there is a chance his girlfriend is real? what is the possibility that this kind of scammer will actually come to nyc and move into my moms house with this man? or like set up some kind of home robbery... if she just tries to solicit him for money through the phone, i don't really care. i will probably help her setup some cameras around the house but i am getting some anxiety from this whole situation. she will be living here alone with them and my dog"

hello! i’m a grocery store worker and we’re now required to wear masks. since i have a latex allergy, i found a company on instagram that sells face masks and purchased four. 

it has been two weeks and no shipping confirmation or anything. the only shipping info i got was through an arrive link that said it would arrive in 7-12 days. i have emailed and dmed the page only to be ignored and left on read. 

i was wondering if anyone else had an experience with them and if they just ship out late and have weak customer skills or if this is a scam. i am also wondering if there is anything i can do to report this company so this does not happen to other people. i find it messed up that if they did scam me, they used something that has both killed and hurt people to make money off of those who are just trying to protect ourselves. i also wonder when i should initate a chargeback, as i’ve never had to do that with an online purchase.

so the story starts with me just getting done with online school (because of quarantine) and hopping on apex. when i get on i get a little message. (gg is the gamer girl i’m talking to who does porn and m is me) 

gg: a clëâr cònscìènce ís ä sùrê sïgn of ã bäd memöry doverwyrm. 

i’m confused so i check there info.nothing. so i reply

m:what’s going on 

gg:i got ure name from the server search here on psn cuz i was bored of playing and looking for someone to talk to

gg: how old are you 

m: 14 
hbu 

gg: 22 years oldgurl... what’s up during quarantine 

i was starting to think she wanted to play somthing so i say (btw if it’s spelled wrong it’s not me it’s how she spelled it)

m: nothing much 
what games u play your all private.

gg: ahh, i just got done playing fortnite i amreally bored ,i was with my friend.

gg: i was really enjoying the time off with my friends ya know?? 

m:ya i get it

so this is where the story turns... mature 

gg: lol, soo i have an idea if ure up for a lil fun

i’m scared but also exited so i say 

m:sure 

gg: what do you think of my quarantine  look today haha!lol

she proceeds to send a picture of her in nothing but a bra and panties 

me trying not to simp says 

m:not bad 

i wasn’t so sure it wasn’t a friend playing a prank with a stock image so i asked

m: send another so i know your real

she does this time with a adult toy . my brain said shit that’s hot.

gg: i was actually going to be getting to my job here shortly. my one friend was working online and i kept askin her about it so she showed me what she was doing when we got back to school last fall

gg: i thought she was out of her mind at first haha, but its pretty cool actually. we work online doing private webcam shows which sounded super crazy at first believe me. but i freakin luv it!!!

ok so now i get it. private webcam that’s a nice way of saying porn. i’m like damn.

m:so porn or what

gg: well what i was going to say is i have some free passes and i usually just do a private show before i get started to warm up lol. no one is online though so i was going to let u use one of the passes if u wanted but u have to give me a really good rating so i can get more if u do tho k? no bra hahah 

my brain exploded. like i said it’s quarantine horny o’clock i’m speechless. she sends another pic with nothing on close up on the tits. i was speechless

m:oh shit

gg: dont u worry tho... ill earn it lol. k its nightinvites . com and u should see a lil button to accept my invite and connect now to create your profile. u just click on that... then you just make ure own username or w/e and u can cumm join my private chat for us two and type to me and tell me what you want me to do. 

so this is when i get suspicious i say

m:that sounds super sus 
this sounds like a scam for horny teens

gg: yeah u do need a card of some kind...
but, its just to verify your age cuz there's a lot of them on here obv

i stated earlier i’m a minor and i told her that so i say

m:i’m 14 tho and i only like free porn.

gg: ofcourse babe

she called me babe so now i’m really sus 

m: this don’t sound free.

gg: u should feel special i dont usually give out this one!!!! loll im such a goofball sumtimes

she’s starting to get annoyed. warning i did kinda simp here sorry 

m: u do got nice tits tho

gg: if you like the twins you’ll love her 

proceeds to send picture of her pleasuring herself.after it a link

m: is this a virus or something.

gg: virus ?? no lol

m: i don’t wanna click

gg: i really can't wait 2 its goin to be so much fun. i love meeting new ppl on here, oh by the way... might wanna turn ure speakers down cuz i can get a lil loud once i get going

m: oh shit that’s tempting 

gg: i'm about to go grab some of my favorite toys i'll brb. hurry up though i better see ure name in my room when i get back lol. 

i don’t know what to do on one hand it’s literally interactive porn but on the other hand it’s probably a scam. i go with my gut and didn’t do it. i looked it up and saw it’s a popular scam on ps4. 

m: this is a scam but if it means anything your hot 

i end with one last remark 

m: i only like porn that doesn’t steal my shit.

so yah it’s a little story that i thought would go nicely here and it’s my first post so be nice."

"i got scammed selling games on reddit :( is there anything i can do or to punish him? title. 

i bought some escape from tarkov keys to gift for my friends, since buying a bundle is cheaper. i managed to sell three of them to the friends we were gonna play with, but i had a fourth one and no on else wanted to play the game. 

basically, i gave him the key in reddit chat. (i should've used some third party trading service.) he said he wouldn't go first, so i went first, being naive as i was. i should've known his account was less than a month old. 

is there anything that can be done about this in terms of punishing this person or getting back what i've lost?"

hi,i am kim_______. i'm satisfied with the price and i'm really interested in buying it. i would have love to come for the viewing by the weekend, but my place is way too far from there in which i am located in british columbia victoria. so i thought of how to make this transaction work between us, which i came to conclusion to use a courier company to pick up the item from your place but we will send the money to your account first and after you get the money in your account, the pick up company will come to help us carry it. since i'd not be seeing the item before i purchase it, i would like you to send some more recent pictures of its present state to be sure you still have it and its in good condition. if the pictures pleases me,then we can go ahead with the transaction and will send the money to you without delay.... lest i forget, i would be transferring the funds to you through paypal. please reply with your opinion asap thanks.

last time this happened like 2 or 3 days ago, same thing.  he asks where are you i gave up a ride for you.  someone from our number called for a taxi.  i say no, we didn't,and he says yes we did.  i told him that time we are in wa state....(truth) and he's calling from california...so no we didn't call for a taxi.  he started getting mad and calling me a liar.  i told him to think what he wanted, but he might not want to pick up rides from this (our) number anymore.  he started getting huffy/pissy and i just hung up.

today, again.  he calls, asking where are you and i told him look, you need to block this number we are in washington state and the next thing i know he's hung up.

"got emails for years and now getting texts? hi,

for a couple years i got intermittent emails (maybe like 15 total) from people who thought i was ""donna ruseau"". i'm a dude named dan. i tried to email back and say that wasn't me but it never helped. the weird thing is if i click for more info on the emails her name appears next to my email address and not my name. this was all strange but didn't concern me, just figured it was a weird email error. 

today i got an angry text from someone telling off someone named ""donna"" in a lot of angry expletives. i obviously reply with who the fuck is this i have no idea who you are. remembering the donna email incidents i ask if it was for ""donne ruseau"" and he says yes. this is now slightly concerning because i have no idea how my phone number and email have now been linked to this random person. 

should i be concerned about some type of identity theft or nah?"
"can anyone vouch for cumshots.com? my antivirus blocked some links within the site as potentially dangerous - i would be gifting [cumshots.com](https://cumshots.com) the capability to install trojans on my computer which could record the keys i type and thereby steal my passwords, id and bank details.

as a lay person i get that an interactive game probably needs this capability for the game to work. but it seems one hell of a big ask to trust them implicitly by gifting them so much potentially destructive power.

presumably, if that power has already been used to raid people's bank accounts and crash their computers, someone would have raised the alarm by now?

so far, in searches, i have not happened upon a clamour of [cumshots.com](https://cumshots.com) users who report, ""i've been playing this game for months and had no problems at all, it's worth every cent of the $40 a month.""

can any of you guys link me to a tech site where someone might have posted a tech report/review of [cumshots.com](https://cumshots.com)?

they have been advertising widely across major platforms like pornhub and chaturbate for at least 2 months, so by now a lot of people will have a large stake in this security issue. if they are running a genuine, honest business, they must be losing out big time on potential revenue they could be collecting, for the sake of a trusted independent source that verifies their integrity and reliability as a business operation which depends on the installation of trojan software on customers' computers."

so this looks like a procedurally generated email address and i'm guessing this person is trying to bypass the craigslist email relay system so they can proceed with initiating a scam on me.  this is not surprising.

what surprises me is that it's a ***gmail*** address.  ostensibly, google is pretty good at preventing their services from being used for illicit purposes, but this person/bot seems to be doing it.  is there any way to alert google to this?  wouldn't they want to know if someone had cracked their captcha and was procedurally generating ""reputable"" gmail address to scam people?"

"paypal linked to ebay - a source of spam emails   hi there, i just wanted to show my findings and see if anyone else has noticed this.

**the experment:**

i've been running an experment since march 2017 to try and identify where people scrape emails from to add to their big lists to spam you with.

i created over 153+ email accounts and setup an email account for each individual site i used and would use from this moment on. trust me it's a pain to keep track but i have lastpass to know which emails do what. it took me about 2-3 months to finally migrate over to this new email system.

in this experment, i forwarded all the emails to my primary email account so that i don't have to log into each account to get my emails. 

**results**

one spam email i got was via amazon, but it was a sales email via amazons 'contact the buyer system' trying to offer me discounts to their store outside of amazon. as soon as i told amazon, they told me that is against their policies to contact buyers this way and gave them a slap on the wrist i'm guessing. i personally count this as spam but in the case of the experiment, i don't.

what i'm classing as spam email is emails that are sent from someone you've never directly interacted with, with emails being vague and not including your name. 

long story short, to date (36 months later) with my spam filters 100% off, i've received 4 spam emails (3 if you're not including the amazon sales email).

the remaining 3 100% spam emails paypal email account that i exclusively use with ebay. what's interesting is that it's not my ebay email they're sending spam to but my paypal email they're spamming. two of these emails have been in the last two weeks. the email consists of tracking images (they tell the sender that the image has been downloaded when the email is opened) and url links that are email specific with a nice unsubscribe link. you can edit this link to any email account and it'll say you're on the mailing list and you can opt out any time. 

   
 

**actions**

two of the spam emails are from the same person (same image and style of email) and the first email was from a different domain which has already been shut down. the second one is live today. i've looked up the mailing server and the domain registrar and reported both but i'm sure this will not stop them but what's interesting is that the servers and domains are based in europe (i'm from the uk). also posted this under r/paypal

   
 

tldr; i'm getting spam to the email account registered to paypal from ebay purchases."

as you may know, there's this giant nintendo switch drought going on, and me wanting to redeem the benefits of my recent check, i wanted to get one. i ended up getting lucky enough to find one on this newish-looking third party merchant called allatronix. they say they are a company based in california, and based on the ""research"" i've done, they've only been around for 2-3 months. halfheartedly, i bought one of their switches, costing me about $385 ($360 including shipping+handling). they also let me track my order through arrive, which assured me a little bit. however, when i checked their customer service/refund page, it seems to be literally copy-pasted from a handful of other websites. its been about two days since that purchase and im getting cold feet. i've emailed them twice now and tried to reach them by phone, but no response. in fact, their cellphone number doesn't even work. i'm hoping its just me being nervous, but i wanted to put this post out here who find themselves in the same situation. any kind of help would be appreciated.

"how likely am i going to be blackmailed? so multiple people have told me that i’m going to be okay, but i need something better than someone telling me they think everything’s going to be fine and i think this subreddit is my last chance at this. i’m a very anxious person, so i always think worst case scenario. so basically, i accidentally exposed my face on a sexual video call on snapchat. i did have a very silly, surprised face which i’m worried is exactly what might be the type that might go viral. the person that this was done was met on a subreddit where you find other men to snap with. the bigger problem is that it i’m a closeted bisexual and i know it’s 2020 and all, but i am not ready to come out yet especially in a way like this. the other person lives in a different continent across the world and he may or may not have searched for my ip address, but other than that there’s nothing else that could reveal my identity. except for my face. so i basically have three main questions. how likely is a video like that to go viral? how easy is it to search for someone with just a face? what steps can i take in order to protect myself and have a better peace of mind? i’m sorry if this is confusing, i have been freaking out like crazy and being alone during quarantine has made me only been worrying about this. 

other things of possible importance: i never got a notification for screen recording, but he was most likely using an android and there are ways to screen record on androids snapchat without notifying the other person. he also hasn’t unadded me yet or blocked me, so i sent him a message explaining my situation but it seems that he only uses the account once in a while. i don’t know if this means he’s planning to keep in contact so he can blackmail me, or he just forgot to unadd me because he has no reason to because he’s just a normal dude with no bad intentions."
"checking/debit card scam today i noticed a pending debit in my checking account for $35 with the description of “joster llc” with a string of numbers after it. i did not recognize this charge, nor had i used that debit card in months. 

i noticed the string of numbers was phone number length so i called it. when i called, a machine immediately answered and told me to “press 1” if i was callling about the charge in my account. red flag triggered. 

i hang up, call my bank, and they said they don’t have any other details about it other than it’s classified as a convenience store. they also said not much can be done right now since the debit is still “pending” and that it will either “post” and go through fully or drop off by monday. they told me if it’s still there by monday to call back. 

my “balance” in my account is (for example) $1000 and my “available balance” is $965. it appears the money is still in my account. 

anyone heard of this scam? do i need to be concerned that some company i never heard of was able to charge a transaction to my interest account and now the $35 is held in limbo?

any advice or similar experiences appreciated."
"help me see if this website is legit, please. the website is: https://jaraguar.com/

i checked scamadviser which gave it a trust score of 80%. however, i don't always trust sites that do a ""background check"" on websites.

i was looking at purchasing some retro soccer jerseys from them, as they are the cheapest you will find, but i want to make sure it is legit first. 

i have purchased from sites like this before and i am fairly sure it is legit, just want to make sure."

"marvel 23 movie collection ad on facebook lately, i've been seeing this ad on facebook about this ""marvel 23 movie disc collection"" and by observing some of the post's comments, people claim it is legit. however, some of the pictures of the collection set look half-baked. most of the pictures printed on the disk are theatrical posters and the labeling of each movie is written in comic sans font. i saw one picture of a different ad viewing the back of the box and i remember it saying ""made in taiwan"" or something.

as far as i'm concerned, the 23 movie set was released by marvel studios as a limited edition thing and the box itself looked astonishing with the amount of detail that went into it.

i looked into this company called ""wiinshop"" and it seems that it's based in portland, oregon. they sell media collections in the same capacity. anybody have prior experience dealing with them?

what do you all think? should we raise awareness?

"help: received 600 dollars in bank account a friend of mine just got an offer via instagram to be a sugar baby. the guy w her 600 dollars through e-transfer and the money did go into her bank account. then he turned around and stated he didn’t understand that he had a limit to what he could e-transfer and asked her to e-transfer 300 dollars to someone. so she did and he came back a second time saying something similar and when she returned to try to get information he blocked her. luckily the cheque did not go through and the bank put it on hold and so no monies went out of her account. what just happened?

"phone scam of the personal kind -advice please! so i got a call from my girlfriend telling me an anonymous person just called her asking for my number and said they were an old friend/person who knew me from my home town and they got her number from an old phone i think (not possible). he then asked if i was her boyfriend to which she replied yes. the rest of the conversation is a little hazy as she was so confused/ surprised but essentially she said she'd message me (before giving any details out), since it was an anonymous number they were presumably aware they would not be contacted back. the personal details they knew about us are really unsettling and i wanted some advice on the situation. they have since (a few hours) not called back. 

details they seemed to know: 
-her name
-my name 
-our relationship status (not available online anywhere) 
-my home town 

we have only been together a matter of months so this is disconcerting. she has little to no social media presence. we communicate mostly over whatsapp when apart and to the best of my knowledge have not shared personal details of each other over emails or anything and just cannot think where someone would get this data. pretty sure we could rule out friends, weird ex's or anything like that. my hometown is in the uk and we both live in germany - the call was in german but she thinks not a native speaker perhaps. 

there are some holes in this somewhere for sure but i really think it's someone who got this data rather than a prank caller or someone either of us know. any advice on this would be great, it's super strange and also a bit worrying. 

many thanks"

"cash wheel scam? this is the offer that i received by someone claiming i can earn a quick $700 dollars profit. 

""basically you cashapp the person in the middle of the wheel $100 and get added tot the wheel. when 8 people fill up the outer ring of the wheel, that person in the middle gets $800 because 8 people sent them $100. then the wheel splits up and a new person gets to the middle and the cycle continues until  you get to the middle and your're getting $800. it takes you 3 circles to the middle but you only pay $100 once. 

don't think you wont get your money because the people under you already put money in so they are going to make sure they get to the middle also. everyone gets paid because everyone want s to get to the middle and everyone will as long as we keep getting people to sign up. not a scam, just an easy way for people to get some extra money. \*\*\* it's not a pyramid scheme , once you're in the middle and get your $800 you're out and have to pay $100 again to re-enter.\*\*\*

we’re we’re taking down our christmas stuff. that done we went back inside. low and behold niki. we searched in and out. this cat had never been outside let alone survive so as days went buy we figured maybe she went to die. i was 12 and a wreck. 
my mom practically hit up everything: shelter animal control he’ll she got a giant picture of the cat in the front yard. a lot of people called but nothing. 

it had been two week life had sadly moved in until i got the phone call
“hi i’m ass here. did you loose a car. of course i said and he gave an intricate story of how my cat had been hit and he’d taken care of it and stated they knew about the reward. i told the guy i was too young to know the details but my dad could help. he got furious essentially in kinder words here were killing my cat. he finally called back but my dad answered where he claimed he’d  only talk to me. in language he doesn’t use. i was a mess with all the things he’s doing to my baby.

"on-going scam  i believe i'm currently a victim of a fraudulent check scam. i was approached via text message with a ""job"" about a week ago now. the college that i'm attending was mentioned so i decided to trust it. i was asked to send money via zelle to ""suppliers"" through funds provided by an ""errands check"". i've sent around $2,000 through multiple transactions via zelle to two different ""suppliers"". it wasn't until yesterday that the check bounced back that i began diving into research on the internet on fraudulent check scams and zelle. i've learned a huge lesson and i am now more skeptical of the world than ever.

this morning, he contacted me for another ""job"" with the same procedures, notifying me i should expect the next errands check in a few days. i am now wondering if there is anything i can do to get him caught, or better yet get my money back. the consensus i'm getting from internet research is my money is lost for good. the police told me to call my bank so they can report the fraudulent check. the bank told me they don't have a department for fraudulent checks, only fraudulent transactions.

i have my ""employer's"" phone number. i have the two e-mail addresses i was required to direct the money to. if there is something that i can do, i would like to. however, if all is lost, i simply want to move on from this uncomfortable experience.

i would kindly like to ask for supportive or informational comments only, please. i was naive. i was dumb. i have a history of self-destructive behavior during these extremely uncomfortable experiences but i am trying to grow out of that. i would like to believe that i am, based on my reaction from this experience.

thanks reddit"

"employment scam earlier this week i received notice from ziprecruiter that my application had been viewed for a remote software job i applied for and shortly after i received an email from a gmail account letting me know i had been selected for an interview. they gave me another gmail to connect with on google hangouts for the interview. it ended up being a chat only interview where they asked me some standard questions about my experience and how i would handle certain team issues. within the next two hours, they offered me the job and then sent me an email with my contract the next morning asking me to sign it and send a copy of it and my id. they listed a bunch of materials that i would be needing for the job to set up my home office (an imac, a printer, some software editing programs, file cabinets, etc) and told me that they would send me a check to purchase the material through their approved vendor. i received the check today and it is approximately $6600 dollars, which seems accurate given the cost of an imac. however, i'm getting some red flags that i would like some confirmation about.

first, gmail accounts instead of a company one. they're giving me names of people that i can verify work for the company via its website and linkedin. however, the first email is of the person's name slightly spelled incorrectly, just missing one repeating letter.

next, the google hangouts chat interview is just so strange i don't know how to begin since it's so different than any interview i've ever had.

the check has me the most concerned. how could this hurt me if this isn't legitimate? they want me to deposit it via atm specifically. (any idea why?) 

the more i look at this the more uncomfortable it makes me. the company website itself is legit so i reached out to their listed email for confirmation and i've sent a message to the person i'm supposedly interviewing with on linkedin and i'm waiting on a response."
"the “free dog only pay shipping” scam has anyone else been scammed this way or heard of this scam. i just read about it online and it seems super similar to what’s happening to me right now. beautiful pups, free if i pay to have them shipped. owner kind and asking lots of questions, but refusing to give phone number and ignoring my offer to just drive up and pick the doggo up.

update: 

so i got the call from the dog movers it’s an indian man with a thick accent, with clear background noise, “hi i am calling about delivering your puppy” 

just the way he pronounced puppy made my skin crawl. i asked him if they had a website i could check out, and he immediately went into, “no well i’ll tell you why we can’t do that, because then the bad people....” i tuned out. this was the worst made up excuse i had ever heard.  

it was clearly a scam. i told him how sad i was they were scamming people and went to hang up. the last thing i hear is, “hold on you’ve got a pretty voice.” 

uh huh 

should’ve known it was too good to be true."

"possible job scam? so today i got a text(not an email) about interviewing for a remote data entry position. anyways, i was happy about this because i'm currently jobless and the position was remote and would pay $24/hour. then a part of me started questioning this. the thing is, i don't remember applying to this and i also don't have any receipts of my application to this company. they then asked me to log onto a chatroom in trillian and have a chat interview there, which i thought was very informal.

the company seems to check out, i'm just not sure about the people who i'm talking to since they don't really seem to exist anywhere. i also looked up the position i'm being interviewed for and it is listed on so many sites, however, when i look at the company site, there were no job postings for the position i am being interviewed for. could it just be that there are people posing as employees for this company?

i'm just suspicious because this just seems very rushed and unprofessional, but also too good to be true. like $24 an hour for a data entry internship seems too good to be true.

any advice/opinions on what i should do would very much be appreciated!

edit: the company is helion energy. like i said, the company itself seems legit, just not so much the people interviewing."

the name box will have one name but the email will have a different name if it has a name in the email. then the address won't make sense and the subject will be something weird like ""bandwidth"" and the message will also be weird something like ""orange"".

i greatly appreciate your input."
"fraudulent amazon charges- was i hacked or did a friend steal my debit card info? wednesday morning i woke up to find two pending amazon transactions on my bank account for \~$40 each. i was confused because i hadn't ordered from amazon in months. before calling amazon/my bank to dispute these charges, i decided to do a little digging first.

i opened my full transaction history on my banks website and typed amazon in the search bar. i then found 34 different small charges dating back to september of 2019. i pulled up my amazon account in a separate tab and cross-referenced my actual purchases with the charges on my bank statement--only 12 of them actually belonged to me. 22 of them were fraudulent.

before anyone lectures me, i know how irresponsible it is that i had not noticed this much earlier. however, the majority of the charges were $10-30 and frankly i don't closely monitor my bank account transactions. (i learned my lesson, obviously). because the purchases were spread out and relatively small, i didn't notice. my bank account balance was always within the realm of what i thought it was so i never had a reason to suspect anything.

after noticing the fraudulent charges i called amazon first. i gave them the dates and totals of all of the fraudulent transactions. using this data they were able to track down the purchases. the consultant informed me that my card was being used on another members amazon account. she would not tell me the name of the account holder or the location of the shipping address for 'security purposes.' i thought this was bullshit considering my name and bank information were used to make the purchases but whatever. she did tell me though that if i could correctly name the account holder she could in fact verify their identity.

i started listing off the names of a few family members and my roommate. she denied all of these. i was exasperated and asked her if it was possible that i knew them. she couldn't answer that. i then asked her if their shipping address was in my city, to which she replied ""*i would just continue naming names if i were you.""* i took this as her way of verifying that the person using my card lived near my listed address, without directly saying it because couldn't for legal purposes. if the person using my card lived in another state or country she wouldn't have suggested that i keep guessing, right?

i couldn't think of anymore names at the time and was in a hurry to contact my bank to report the fraudulent charges so i thanked her for her time and hung up. my bank has agreed to refund the amount of all of the charges but it will take a few months. in total, the combined amount of all of the charges added up to **$460**.

it's been two days and this is really starting to bug me. at first i thought that i had my bank information stolen by a hacker. but the logistics of it really don't make sense. if a hacker had access to my bank account for *eight* months, wouldn't they have fully cleared me out by now? from my understanding of hackers, they start with smaller purchases to test your card and then, after verifying that it works, they go for the big money. whoever was doing this had the power to clean out my bank account but instead went for smaller, inconspicuous purchases that i wouldn't notice if i wasn't paying close attention.

i thought maybe a server at a restaurant or someone could have taken a picture of my card or something. but that theory didn't make sense either. amazon requires you to provide your billing address. even if someone had gained access to my wallet while i was distracted, they wouldn't have been able to find my billing address because it differs from the address on my license. my billing address is my current apartment while my license address is still my parents house.

the fact that only a select handful of people know my apartment address as well as the fact that they stole such a small amount of money (in the grand scheme of things) is leading me to believe that the person responsible for this is definitely someone i know. 

i'm young and inexperienced in all of this. i don't want to believe that one of my close friends would steal from me but none of the other possibilities make sense. what is the likely-hood of this being a hacker/stranger? is it common for hackers to steal such small amounts of money over an extended period of time and never attempt a larger purchase? i'm really at a loss here."

"way.com class action lawsuit reddit,

have you or anyone you know had issues getting refunds from [way.com](https://way.com) that were against their policy? i have a small group of people that have had issues similar to mine.. [way.com](https://way.com) owes me $398 and have been yanking me around for 2 months. we are looking to gather more to file a class action lawsuit. we have representation and strong backing. from reviews on the internet, it seems that many have had similar issues with no refunds... long before covid-19, which they keep using as an excuse for complications.

i've also found from asking around, informally, that [way.com](https://way.com) hasn't paying the constituents they've been collecting money on behalf of. the garage i had paid for 2 months of service hadn't received any payments from [way.com](https://way.com) for longer... but that's a separate issue that i'm sure they'll take care of. not my biz. just a note. 

i filed a dispute with my credit card company that is still pending but they have been trying to coerce me into dropping the dispute with promises of refunds they should have made long ago... but haven't, and are using language i've been advised is inaccurate and a tactic to avoid the above mentioned dispute. 

if anyone has had experience, please email [waydispute@gmail.com](mailto:waydispute@gmail.com).

"scammers were pretty bold on this one this is a developing story so we’re still trying to determine all of the details. 

yesterday, my girlfriend’s mother (babs) noticed that someone in a black nissan (with opaque tinted windows) was parked in her driveway. she went out to investigate but they drove off quickly. she thought it was weird but thought nothing more about it. 

later that day, she called synchrony to pay her credit card bills (her tj maxx and belk cards are distributed though this company) and the representative told her that the accounts she was trying to pay had been closed, but the accounts she’d opened *that day* had accrued a $2000+ bill (at sam’s... incidentally in my town 45 minutes away and at my girlfriend’s current place of employment). 

babs immediately realized she’d been scammed and they transferred her to the fraud department. the company told her that yesterday morning, someone had called synchrony as babs (with her name, address, and last 4 of her ssn) and stated that the cards had been lost and requested new ones overnighted to her address.

she immediately had those cards cancelled and realized that the black nissan must have been the one to cancel the original cards and intercepted the fedex truck at the front door when the driver delivered the new cards. 

babs called the police first (in her town where the theft took place and in our town where the illegal spending took place), and then today called fedex to report the theft and to ask if fedex could interview that driver about who intercepted the cards at her house. fedex called back later after talking to the driver and explained that the driver had been approached by an african-american man in a wal-mart parking lot near babs’  home and asked him if he had a package for [babs’ full name] at [her home address] because they were headed out of town and didn’t want to wait for the truck to get to the house. 

the fedex guy just... handed the parcel of cards over. (we’re still waiting for fed-ex to get back to us about whether the guy asked for id or any other descriptive details.) we think now that the black nissan was backup, waiting to intercept the fed-ex man, if he didn’t give the other scammer the cards in the parking lot. 

to top everything off, the cops are giving babs the runaround. her town is saying since the fraudulent purchases were made in our town, that our pd needs to investigate. our pd is saying since the card theft occurred in her town, her pd needs to investigate. after fed-ex interviews their driver, they intend to call her pd and file a follow-up report. 

the main concerning issue is that these scammers know where she lives, and we have no idea how some local scammers would have that much detailed information. 

so (like previously mentioned) this story is still developing, but is it normal for scammers to be this ballsy? the fed-ex guy can provide a description of one of the scammers and his car. babs can id the nissan in her driveway. sam’s has cameras all over the place. i’m sure the cc company has a number logged for that initial call. i’m sure we’ll track them down soon. 

my question for y’all in the meantime: is there anything else we need to do to protect babs? she’s cancelled cards. she’s setup a po box so her mail is sent there. she’s called two police departments and fed-ex is following up with their own report. what else can/should we do?"

"how to car insurance robocalls scam work? did i give away to much information before i felt something fishy and hung up? how do auto insurance scams work? did i give away to much information?

so i got a call and they were saying that they could get me lower rates on my car insurance and they are partnered with state farm and some other auto insurance companies. 

the operator asked me for my first name which i gave 
and then asked me for my zip code which i gave 

and she asked me for my current insurance provider which i also gave 

and then asked how many cars i have and i felt something wasn’t  right so i lied on that question said 2 when i only had 1. 

then i hung up and checked the phone number online and people were saying that phone number is a scam and that they are trying to get your information to either a. steal your identity or make a false claim against you. 

so i gave
-first name
-zip code
-insurance provider

did i give away to much before i hung up? and how do these insurance scam works like i know they try to steal identity but how do they use those information to steal idenitly"

"is approveemail.com legit or a scam? i have a relative who received emails concerning a loan request for her deceased mother from  the website [approveemail.com](https://approveemail.com). while i haven't been able to find much information on it, i suspect it is a scam site where they send the email with a person's 'soft' personal information that is relatively easy to get a hold of (e.g. last 4 of driver's license, last 4 of checking account, etc) and if the person attempts to 'go through with' the loan request, they have to put in their real information which lets the identity thieves do their thing.

so does anyone know if this site is legit, or is it a potential scam site?"
"""macmillan publishing"" impersonator-upwork scam this scam was pretty convincing. the post on upwork read something like ""copyeditors/proofreads/editors and somebody called renee messaged me a verification code. she said i could either use google hangout or skype. this guy called himself van macmillan. eventually, after i got the fake job, they told me i had to purchase equipment but that they would provide me with the funds. then they sent this badly doctored check, and it was all over. they even spelled my last name wrong and it's supposed to be a publishing company. they had a contract written up and that looked pretty real. they had taken the post down when i'd started talking to them. i saw that they posted again recently without the caps but with the same title. i flagged it and i think it got taken down."
any experiences with drvnsport.com? i think i might’ve been scammed.

i can't reset the password because the account under my email no longer exists. i tried to reset the new account entering my gmail as a back up and it took me to a page asking for my first and last name postal code etc. is that how this scam works? to find out your info?

what i want to know is how the hell microsoft allows an account to be created without the consent of the gmail account, just through a phone number. i'm very stressed out right now. i changed my passwords and ran windows defender scan and malwarebytes. the email was sent in the early morning long before i woke up. 


does anyone know more about this? i searched it and found a few results on the microsoft forums with little information on what to do and mixed results about if my email is compromised or not

"somebody has been using my name in a very strange way! random hotel reservations in my name and a mysterious package containing a brand new cell phone. i’m not sure if this is the right place to post this but something very strange has been going on. some background: i live in a very small town where my family and i are very well known as my mother owns one of the longest running businesses here. i don’t have a particularly common name, and generally i go by a nickname not by my full name on all social media and everything i go by the shortened version. i’ve never heard of anybody else with the same name living anywhere near me. 

last week a local bed and breakfast owner contacted my mom and asked if i had made a reservation to stay a night (april 8th). she said it was my full name, and my actual postal code, but whoever it is used a mastercard (i don’t have a mastercard) and they never showed up for the reservation. she said she tried to charge the card a no show fee and it didn’t go through. i asked my husband if he could have accidentally booked something (he doesn’t have a credit card at all anyway) and he didn’t. my mother and i convinced the owner it wasn’t me and we apologized for the trouble and all was good but i was pretty weirded out even though it was harmless enough. 

fast forward to today ‘i’ apparently made another reservation for this sunday night with a different credit card (i checked my card, there’s no charges nothing seems compromised). but the extremely weird part is the b&amp;b owner got a package today with my full name on it, but addressed to their address and it has the business name of the b&amp;b on it. they opened the box after contacting us and it says it is from oakville ontario (we are also in ontario). it’s a brand new samsung galaxy and a new sim card.. no receipt or anything other than a phone and sim in the box.

what the hell is happening here?? i would appreciate any advice or input, thank you!"
"something troubling just happened so some background. i already fell into a sextortion scam back in october, and that has always been in the back of my mind. so today, my dad received a text from my phone that just showed a download link. i didn't send anything and he didn't open it in case it was a virus. clearly it was something bad, but would it in any way be related to the sextortion scam from back in october, or is it something different and unrelated to me?"
this is safe right? 
"gold box shipment... this is a scam right? ok so this all happened just now, my aunt sent me an email and asked me to check its authenticity. i did look up the email title and the name of the company and it looked legit..

the email title was: ""courierpost logisticsservice"" and the details of the sender were this: ""logistics shipping company. london express, courierpost air, sea and land logistics shipping company""

after googling the name of the company (courierpost) i found out that its based in new zealand, but i also found a linkedin page and some info on beta.companieshouse.gov.uk , which i believe all can be made up. the new zealand website does not include any info on a branch in london. 

then my aunt asked me how to exchange money to bitcoin, and i asked her what does she want bitcoin for, and told her that transactions with bitcoin cant be tracked, which unsurprisingly, she didn't know.

ok, back to the email story, the email included some info about two shipping options, one 1850£, international same day shipping, the other 1350£ 

so let me give some background info, my aunt met this guy on instagram, and he told her he's a military doctor in iraq, and he has a stash of gold being shipped to our country, but he doesnt have access to his bank info, and he asked her how much she can pay for the box and told her she can then take whatever she spent from the stash, in gold bars. she agreed to pay 100$ but seems like he made her rise it to 200$. at this point it was pretty obvious for me that its a scam, but she didnt believe me. i told her that the shipping company was asking for much more than that, and she said the guy has sent her a message and told her to email this back to the company:

""good evening sir , i have read your mail and it's understandable ,  but i have a little issue with the price that was written above , please sir i can only afford 200$ dollar for the delivery and i don't have a currency account , but i can pay it through bitcoin office , i will be glad if my request is granted 
thanks 
*name*""

now this is obviously bs, since no company does random acts of charity for random people who cant even afford a sixth of the shipping price. then, i checked the email again. this is the email address of the ""shipping company"":

courierpost-logistics.services@inbox.eu

its an inbox email! lol there is not even a website

i do also have the instagram id of the guy who sent her all the info, but i dont know if its ok to just write it here..
also, the email included an attachment which was a photo of the shipment, [here](https://m.imgur.com/a/ottjtqf) it is!
now just take a look at the keypad to just appreciate the effort (or should i say the lack of it!) the right side of it doesnt even align with the side of the box, and it sure looks like a badly photoshopped image. 

anyway, i told her that they're trying to rob her, and not to send anyone any money. 

tl;dr: some random guy on instagram gave my aunt some info about a shipment of gold, and i found out it was a scam."

"how scamming used to work via newspaper i found an interesting older scam involving newspaper want ads while watching a 1985 newscast (don't ask). in the segment a fake business posted help wanted ads in 11 states, and when someone applied for the job, they were told they were hired and asked to send money for a bonding fee. the address went to a blind mail drop and the phone number went to an answering service.

i thought this was interesting in that it's a look into scamming before the age of the internet, and also a rebuttal to everyone on facebook (or at least my facebook friends) who bemoan how terrible everything is these days and how everyone is so crooked. link goes to the video segment. if it doesn't, segment starts at 8:59 and ends at 10:19.

i'm looking at renting a place right now from a swedish equivalent to craigslist (blocket.se), but the landlord is supposedly stuck in another country. they wanted to use a ""multinational"" company for the rental and suggested wmoterne residential apartments. i'm rather skeptical since i can't find anything googling it and the landlord himself linked to many trustpilot-esque sites to ""prove"" that it wasn't a scam. when i google the company name i mostly get results from the sites he linked, but i also get some legit-seeming forum threads asking about the site from about 5 years back.

supposedly we have to send a set amount (equal to a deposit and 2 months rent) to the company, upon which they mail us the keys and give us 10 days to inspect the apartment.

"indeed scam i am just so sad right now because i really needed a job. anyways, here is what just happened to me: 
i was messaged by a number saying that i had moved on to the next step as part of their hiring process. i did not recall applying for a job at their company but they told me they received my resume and application through indeed. i apply to many jobs on there so i thought that i maybe just forgot. anyways, i was pretty excited that a company was interested in hiring me so i pretty much did everything they told me to do. i was asked to download a messaging app called telegram and to contact their hr manager to receive my online interview. i took the interview and it went well and she said i was hired. she gave me a employment letter to fill out and i did. i sent her the photos of the forms. she told me that the job paid $30 an hour. i was so happy to hear that. i feel so dumb now. anyways, after that, she informed me that her company would send me a check for the materials i needed for the job. (at-home data entry clerk.) i told her i already had a computer but she insisted and i didn’t think anything of it since it was their money that i would be spending. the materials she wanted me to buy were a macbook laptop, an iphone x, a printer and some software. a few days later and i get their check in the mail which i deposited in my bank’s atm. the check was for $5000 from a silicon valley bank apparently. my bank notified me that this check will take a week for the funds to be available which was unusual. i didn’t think much of it though. during that week, i was asked to report to her at 8am everyday through the messaging app where she gave me daily tasks such as writing a 1500 words minimum personal intensive findings essay. fast forward to today and the funds are still not available in my account. she asks for me to purchase from their company’s vendor without the check funds- she states that the company will reimburse me. i told her i cannot do that because i don’t have much money left. she then asked me how much money i have in my bank account. she asked me if i can send that amount to the company’s vendor to purchase some software necessary for my training. it was at this point where i checked my history in my bank account to see that the check did not go through and that i have been charged a $12 item chargeback fee. it was at this moment where i confirmed that this whole thing was probably an elaborate scam. i am so sad right now. i should have know from the very beginning when all of our messages were on a messaging app that can delete a whole conversation for both parties.

"youtube $100 gift card scam if any of you watch youtube than sometime recently you’ve probably seen the ads sponsoring a website that supposedly is giving away $100 gift cards. it is a scam, after trying to get one just as a joke, i quickly figured out that it is indeed a ploy from companies to get your consent to robocall, text, email, etc. you. the steps that you’ll see on the ad are true however it is simply a data mining operation for companies to sell. on the videos you’ll also see that the comments section is filled with the exact same comments. i’m assuming it’s a group of people using spam accounts to further convince people as the accounts used are different on each add but the comments are the same. 

at this point i’m just ranting so in short. avoid the $100 gift card ads on youtube they are a scam."
"i'm 99% sure someone is trying to scam me. opinions please? about a month ago i met this girl on tinder. we started talking and we got onto the topic of investing. we are both interested in it so we started talking about it a lot. specifically bitcoin and trading etc.  

we have become quite good friends but i haven't met her and i've had so many red flags making me think she is trying to scam me. amazing because she is playing a really long game.  

heres some of the red flags i noticed:  

1. soon after we started talking she took a solo vacation to italy,  which she sent me pics of. (italy has been in quarantine so i dont know how that was possible)  

2. one of the photos looked strange. her arm looked almost pixelated so i decided to run her pictures through imageedited.com and every single one came back as ""probably edited"". she has sent me over 30 pictures and each one comes back the same, even when i tell her not to use any filters.  

3. she has been scalping bitcoin on metatrader and wanted to take me through the method. i am not stupid when it comes to trading etc so i decided to follow using a demo account and see what its all about. she gave me ""her old practice account"" to use.  

this is where it gets really interesting, the broker she uses allows 200x leverage on btc trades and she uses this frequently. i've traded with her a few times and shes won every time. i mean thousands of dollars in a couple of minutes.  

i decided to google the broker she is using and it didnt come up at all which was a major red flag for me. i eventually plugged in a demo account for a trusted broker onto my metatrader to follow the trades and see if i would still win, which i did.   

this leads us to today. i told her i cant find the broker that she is using online so she sent me the website. i looked through it and its raising more red flags.  

the address is in london, but the site was registered in hong kong (incidentally the country she comes from, and has since returned to because of this covid crisis), i did a street view check of the address and it looks like the company doesn't exist at that address.  

i did a whois search for the domain and it was registered on the same day that me and her started chatting a month ago (coincidence?). she told me she has been trading btc for over 6 months already.  

i haven't called her out yet on these red flags because she hasnt pressured me into sending money anywhere and hasnt asked me any personal information. i'm also learning a lot by following her trades using a demo account so im actually gaining some value for now.  

what do you guys think? what should i do? is there any agency or something that will help confirm my suspicions?  

thanks for the read guys.  

edit: after looking at replies and votes it seems that you guys strongly in favor of me ceasing contact with this person so i am going to block their number immediately."
"i think i'm getting scammed. hey guys, i'm new here, also on mobile so sorry for the formatting. oh and english isn't my primary language. but let's cut to the chase:

on the 7th december 2019 i bought a used (good condition) hp laserjet 2420 from ""scamprinters inc."" they gave no warranty on used products but i'd heard good about them and they said they test and make sure all printers on sale are in good condition. to be fair it really did look good and i didn't notice any damage to it on close inspection. so i bought it for about $80. reason why this specific printer is because i bought it for my dad and he had ink cartridges in stock of said printer. 

it ran smoothly for 3 months, personal used only, it printed roughly in the 100 pages of documents. on the 7th march it stops working, says no paper. paper tray is full, but there's a small piece of plastic on top of the paper. after checking i noticed that the piece of plastic is part of the paper drawing mechanism and that's why it says no paper. so i call up the shop, send em [pictures](https://ibb.co/pysbgns) and video of said problem through whatsapp and they tell me to bring it in. went there 3 times during working hours to find the shop closed but eventually managed to take it in for repairs. that was on the 15th march. a few days after that my country went into total lockdown due to ""rona"". 

fast forward to this monday and i get a text asking if i'd be picking up the printer or if i want it delivered. i call the number, thank them for repairing it and ask what i owe. he says $45, because the technician told him motherboard was fried and had to be replaced. completely false. i asked him to speak to his technician because that is not why i brought my printer in. he says i can speak to him myself and gives me the number. so i call the techie and have a chat. techie says he doesn't work there anymore, but he'd been working on that exact printer the moment the owner (previous guy whom i was talking to came in and fired the technician staff due to the lockdown. told em he'd call them back when the situation was over. said he'd found another job and he wouldn't go back to finish the work. i thank him for his time and call up the owner again. i tell him everything i'd just heard from the techie and asked him how he would be giving me back my ""repaired printer"" when he has no repair staff and my printer is on a desk [torn appart](https://ibb.co/sdjlbwt). he confirms that yes, while my printer was indeed not repaired he thought he would give me another one of the same model at a discount price. 

queue me asking him where the fuck he finds the liberty to switch up my gear with something else and what makes him think i will buy another printer when the one i own is just fine. all it needs is a [$4.50 roller](https://www.printersupplies.com/p-rl1-0542-3.html) and bam. shouldn't be more than $10 labour and parts cost. he then says he is unable to fix printers, he just runs the shop. (shite job at doing that too.) he tells me my only options are either get the other printer for $45 or get my broken printer back. problem is i don't trust him not to give me some other broken or even dead printer. i forgot to take pictures of the device's serial number and don't have any documentation pertaining it. i also haven't recorded any of the calls because i didn't think it was this bad. 

i guess this is my story of how i'm getting scammed, a forewarning for others. if anyone has any advice or tips they're welcome. 

tl:dr op is getting scammed over a $80 printer from ""reputable"" shop."
"about 3 spam calls per minute since about 30 minutes ago, i've been getting nonstop phone calls, each from a different number. it's about 3 of them per minute. i've also gotten probably ten (i deleted the first few) text messages in various languages ending with ""(account kit for facebook)"", which is something i don't think i  signed up for.

&amp;#x200b;

last night i logged in to an app through facebook, scener [https://www.scener.com/](https://www.scener.com/) but it's just a video call app that syncs netflix and was recommended by several other sites, so i figured it was safe. i can't think of anywhere else that i've put my phone number, and disconnected my facebook account from that app.

please explain something for me i was on whisper and a random guy said he wanted to have s*x with me and send me his ''personal profile link''. i knew right away that it would be a scam. when i clicked on the link it shows a dating site that immitate a famous app called ''bigo'' but there are picture of girls and the typical ''are you 18 years old or over?'' questions. so i just press the no button and it still linked me to a different site that wants me to create an account. so i put in random info and got in. it lead me to a scammy looking dating site with profiles of girls. so i suspect it is a romance scam to lure you into giving the girls which is actually the company employees money. so what do you think? what is there intentions? or do they just get commissions from the site they linked me to. sorry for bad grammar and formatting. english is not my first language and i am on phone.
"sextortion scam follow up how likely is it that scammers who blackmail people for money over their intimate pics/vids contact them months / years later demanding money.. i’m guessing the content they have stored never actually gets deleted unless they get caught?? but i’m assume they operate as a network so will always send those files on to someone else who can pick up where they left off. i fell for the scam back in february and have been anxious about them contacting me everyday since then. i’ve had a few suspicious follow requests on ig and feel like this will never actually go away, especially because i paid them the first time round before ghosting them the second time they asked for money. have victims of the sextortion scam been chased for money months or years later?? should i still be worried?? should i try cut down on my social media usage for a few months/years if i am this worried? i can’t stop thinking about it."

"apartment scam - why did they ask for a photo? hello all! so about five years back my (30f) best friend (31f) and i were looking for an apartment together in a new city. i was a  bit less worldly then and didn't really know about the typical apartment scams yet. however i wasn't completely naive so when my friend came across a listing that sounded way too good to be true (2 bed 2 bath condo for rent in swanky looking building right downtown, right near every possible amenity, 2 parking spaces and utilities included) for i think $925/month in the greater toronto area, i was obviously suspicious. that was several hundred dollars less than we were seeing mediocre basement apartments with less stuff going for them listed for. she still really wanted to check it out so said she was going to email them and ask if we could come see it. after some convincing i agreed to that, but told her we were bailing at the first red flag. so she sends an email asking about setting up a time to come see the apartment. she gets a very friendly sounding email back from ""peter"" bypassing her question about viewing the apartment and sending an application but also a bunch of questions. i can't remember the specific questions now but i remember a solid half of them seeming like perfectly reasonable things a prospective landlord would like to know. but the thing that still bugs me to this day is that he asked her to send a photo of herself. i told her do not contact this person again. a couple of days later he sends her another email saying ""i'm sorry if i freaked you out by asking for a photo. i just want to make sure i'm dealing with good people."" and then he tried to push the application on her again.  i said to her that best case scenario this guy was probably a racist scum, and worst case scenario he might be some kind of sexual predator. 

this very much seemed mostly like the run of the mill apartment scam except for the photo part. i still don't fully get it. if it was the fake apartment scam why would he ask for a photo? if he was a sex trafficker or something why didn't he agree to a meeting? just looking for some insight on this one because i still find myself wondering about it years later. thanks in advance!"
"people are pretending to be my friends and calling me more then 24 hours ago i started getting calls from “my friends” or their contacts but when i picked up it was someone random on the other line, clearly not the person the contact was assigned to. when i pick up it’s either silence or several random people taking to me about my credit card or drugs and sometimes just flat out asking for money, saying they’ve found my phone and want compensation which is dumb bc we’re all in quarantine and i haven’t left my house. i thought maybe it was people pranking me but that doesn’t seem right and it’s not just me getting calls, two other friends “called” each other at the same time but ofc it wasn’t them. people are also getting calls from me but again it’s not me, it’s someone pretending to be me. its happened in short bursts over the last two days and i’m really freaked out. i looked it up and read about spoofing but i didn’t understand it and from what i did understand it doesn’t seem like spoofing? plead help. how are they doing this, what’s gonna happen and how do i stop it???"

"my electricity provider sent me a text indicating it was my final bill because someone is stated they were moving into my address. is this a scam? i'm trying to figure this one out. 

i got a 'final bill' notification sms from my electricity provider thanking my for being a customer. i called them up (though the number on their website) and they cleared it pretty quickly, but said it looked like someone had gone through the new account process using my address. 

as such, if i hadn't caught it, i'd have been getting the electricity bill delivered to my own house with someone else's name. just as anyone would when setting up utilities when moving, they would have a brand new account. i've not lost access to my utility account online but changed the password nonetheless but it doesn't look like there's been any infiltration there.

the rep said that this account holder was going to be contacted to verify their address.

i'm wondering:

a) this is a possible scam attempt, and trying to figure out what would be gained? maybe someone trying to state they live here stealing the mail with their name/address?

(b) how the electricity provider blindly going through with the new account process, closing mine without verifying with me...

my bank is currently closed but i’ll be calling in the morning. my bank has not posted an image.

unfortunately, you haven't completed the assignment, and this situation significantly spoils our business reputation. please, understand that your poor performance puts our sales to a stop and endangers our operations in general, particularly in the usa. so, we recommend you 3 ways:

***first way:***  
you transfer the funds today to our receiver as per instructions: you take your remuneration and pay the money transfer fees from our part of funds. after that you send me a full report and we will forget about this incident and you will be able to continue your work with us.

***second way:***  
you take only your remuneration with an additional $150.00 as the final compensation and transfer the rest of money to our receiver, send me a full report. after that, as soon as the funds arrive, we forget about this incident and cancel the agreement not claiming our lawful right to demand from you compensation of damage. so, we will not continue working with you if you choose this way.

***third way (the worst for both parts):***  
you don't transfer funds to our receiver and break the agreement terms. this way we contact the customer asking him to cancel the payment and we will file a suit and charge you for fees also (all attorney's fees and the penalties, which provided in paragraph #11 of our agreement, at the rate of 0.1% per day of the annual salary amount for each day of your inactivity). so i believe that the first and second way is the most suitable for you and for us. please let us know your final decision.

"$1000 charge, email confirmation was sent to me, tipping me off - how does this scam work? [posting for a family member that isn't on reddit]

i got an email from a likely fake website for a nearly 1k charge on my credit card for some expensive thermometers, to be delivered to an address in the same state as me, under the name of my son (he does not live at this address). the charge was real, so i called the bank, had the card cancelled and then immediately after, started receiving hundreds of spam emails, saying my email was signed up for all sorts of things all over the world, for hundreds of different businesses, to the extent that i can't use my e-mail account because i'm getting so many.

how does this scam work? ostensibly, they were trying to get away with the original 1k charge, but then why have the email confirmation sent to me, tipping me off? why not just use my card, and have a receipt sent to a fake email? the website doesn't even appear to sell legitimate items (it lists a whatsapp number, and very little else), so why even bother having it send a receipt at all? i understand that they would send hundreds of emails to potentially try to bury a fraudulent transaction, but the fraudulent transaction was the first email i got, and the rest didn't start coming until half an hour later, after the card was cancelled.

i've frozen my credit with all the bureaus, changed passwords on everything (bank, amazon, ebay, etc) and checked order histories to make sure a fraudulent order wasn't archived, and had all new cards sent out from all my accounts. is there anything else i need to do to protect myself?"

"valve fraud prevention team if you get a message on steam that is super submissively saying ""i accidentally reported you for duping and the admin won't listen, you should talk to them"". this is a scam. they almost got me but i locked my account and changed all my login info as an extra precaution. if you do talk with them, ask them immediately if they are ""a steam admin"". if they say yes, block them, change any information you gave them, and pray to god. if they say they're part of the ""valve fraud prevention team"", do as previously stated. luckily i stopped them before any damage could've been done.   


stay safe, folks. don't be stupid like me."

"m21globalcenter online dating scam new online dating scam, fyi! matched with a guy on tinder who said he was born in italy, living in london (claimed to co-own a menswear store in london with some friends from finance school), and had grown up in china because his father owned an investment firm. he asked for my whatsapp, and we began messaging. his number had a hong kong country code. 

after a couple of days of him talking about how good he is at investing, sympathetically listening as i talked about difficult personal things, and lines that sounded way too good to be true: “it would be an honor to teach a good woman like you to make good investments” and “my one condition for teaching you is that i travel to you afterward so that we can have a romantic dinner,” he offered to teach me about investing in bitcoin. 

he asked me to register for a website, m21globalcenter.com, to start and then told me to talk to customer service (probably him as well, who knows 😂) to make my deposit. luckily, i did not do that. at this point, i decided to reverse-search his images on google and found that they were stolen from a model named filippo cremaschi. i searched for info about the website he linked me to, and found so little that i took it as a red flag. fortunately after some more digging, this thread popped up. thanks to everyone who posted their stories. let’s spread the word so that more people don’t get scammed! 

gonna add in some search terms so that it hopefully pops up more easily for other people than it did for me: m21globalcenter.com , m21globalcenter.zendesk.com ,

"is this a scam? - snapchat “plugs” i thought this would be the best place to go. 

my friend posted on her snapchat advertising someone selling iphones, macs, airpods and electronics basically. 
he claims he will send you the tracking reference the morning it’s sent, and you’ll get receipts of the purchase as well. 
my pal said she kind of trusts it because of the tracking order, she said we can order her airpods, her dads phone and my iphone all together if she wants. 
claiming if anything happened her dads ordered something and he won’t let his money just go to waste .

he even said to her, if one of your friends orders from me first you’ll see it’s legit and they get it.

i’m unsure whether to pay get the phone or not bother, is it a scam?

"is this an obvious ebay scam? i am new to selling might feel like an idiot but this seems too good to be true. i received an offer of $180 plus more for some shoes. here is a copy pasted text from the buyer.


“alright. i want it shipped to my cousin in okay, oklahoma as her birthday gift. i would like you to also get a ebay gift card of $300 included in the package before shipment, i work with the us marines and not able to have it shipped, i will add $300to your payment for the ebay  gift card, $30 for gas and stress &amp; $50 to cover for the shipping cost”

the guy seems nice enough, i’m texting him back and forth. if i ship his sister the shoes with delivery confirmation and signature upon delivery, is there anyway i can get scammed still? his ebay has no feedback but 30 positive ratings in the last 12months. no items listed for sale, but has been a member since 2008 and it says his location is in france. 

i am now getting emails in my junk folder saying there is payment pending until i send gift card details.

"virtual executive assistant job hey all, i'm in need of some opinions, and past experiences. i applied to a job position as a virtual assistant on indeed a few days ago. it doesn't have crazy pay or anything, $15-$16 an hour, but it is based in california so it's a little over minimum wage. the job states i would be working full time, sometimes over 50 hours a week. the job duties are scheduling, taking notes during virtual meetings, booking flights, uploading blog posts, update social media amongst other tasks no mention of cashing checks or buying anything. where i'm running into an issue though is: 

1. the name of the person in charge. it sounds really fake! but also not so fake that i would pass this potential opportunity over. people do have the craziest names sometimes.

2. there is very little information on the company itself. it has a linkedin but with zero info and only one person on there. there is no facebook page, no instagram, and twitter is active but very few followers or interaction. the website exists, but it has a lot of broken links, no privacy agreements, or additional info. 

3. location: some info says it's in la, other info says it's in texas.

4. theres absolutely nothing on better business bureau.  

i have a phone interview in the next few days and have gotten a google voice number to protect my phone number. i also will obviously not give out any info, but in doing so i do wonder how tax stuff would go, hr, etc. i don't know if i'm just being super paranoid. i know sometimes people with startups or smaller business may not have the same resources or processes as larger more established companies but i just want to be on the safe side and get you alls opinion. what gets me is there isn't enough info for me to be totally comfortable with it, but there's also enough info for me to not follow up with this. you get me? idk you tell me."

"facebook marketplace hijack/scam hello. i didn't see this on the scam master list. wanted to see if anyone else had experience with it/make sure people are aware that it happens.

i share an admin role on a facebook business page. one of our admins had their fb account compromised and i was booted off as an admin along with everyone else except for the compromised account. i was alerted to this change by facebook, and i inquired with my coworker. i told her to change her passwords, opt for two factor authentication, and to restore me as an admin. as far as i could tell looking from the outside, that was the only change that had taken place. no defacing of the business or posting any announcements with phishing links or anything like that.

a few days later i went into the office and got repeated wrong numbers inquiring about a car for sale. turns out, the infected account posted under the business name to facebook marketplace all around the country advertising a car for the same exact amount as the $1200 stimulus checks. when i regained admin access i surveyed the damage, and noticed hundreds of messages asking about the car.

as far as i can tell, my coworker shut out access from anyone but her but it still appears that the scammer has a bot or something auto-replying to interested buyers with a gmail account. i reported the hijacking to facebook, who want me to notarize something to prove it's my business page (which i think is overkill, i wasn't locked out by a squatter, this is a different kind of problem). i manually went through the messages and told everyone to report the scam to facebook. i have the scammer's gmail account, but as far as i can tell there is no way to report to google that a gmail account is phishing without having received the message yourself.

is there anything else i'm missing? i want to remove my coworker as an admin, just to be on the safe side, but i have to wait seven days to do so as a ""new"" admin. any advice would be appreciated. thank you."
"nextdoor scam or harassment? every so often a guy on the nextdoor app always posts this:

“hi, everyone,
would you please ask police to stop the people in [redacted apt address] and rescue my family from their control and hurts?
a chinese couple, mami and her husband, paid money to hire a group from a debt-collecting company, ca, to monitor and hurt us every day. 
so far, exposed this group includes a leader, one monitor group and one action group. the monitor group leader has a nissan car with plate number [redacted license plate]. the holder of [redacted apt address] let this group live in their apartment. the action group leader was arrested 2 times in [redacted] high school when they hurt my child in [redacted] high school. 
they are very professional. (1). made troubles between me and people or directly called my boss and let me lose jobs one time followed another time. i have not jobs for 13 years. (2).to break down my family. arranged a man to sleep with my wife. this man also controlled my wife to insult me. (3). they made troubles between my father and me. (4). they hurt my child and controlled my child. some times my child did not listen to me and his mother and listened to them. i show you a recent example. because of virus, i did not permit my child to open the door. they could tell my child to open the door through internet or monitor equipment in my room. (5). they used chemical or medicine to hurt our body or control us. they have the keys of my family.  i got ill for 2 days and just recovered from their chemicals hurt. maybe somebody came in my apartment in the night and put chemical in my cooked vegetables. they also used chemical to make my wife mad in the past. since they told me they used chemical for us, and sometimes they used us to do chemical test, i could not test the chemicals in our body and could not provide evidences. when we were hurt by chemicals, we only went to hospital and we could do nothing. 
so day to day of past 10 years in [redacted city], they publicly hired people to hurt us and followed us. one time, they said they cost about 1.5 million dollars to hire people. they said on line they got 10000000 china yuan from ma mi and her husband in the past 30 years. 
ten years every day in [redacted city] from 2011 to now, why will they not stop? they said if police do not stop them, they will continue and never stop. actually, you do not know that they started from 1991. they had followed and monitored and recorded and hurt me and my family for 30 years day to day. i think nobody believe that. but they spoke some crimes they did at some times and made you to confirm that are true. you maybe fell strange here. these people are distinct from all other crimers. in the past more than 20 years, i always had troubles but i did not know there was a professional group behind. until recent several years, this group and their leaders are exposed. they also said mami and her husband chaizhi, hired them. at first i did not believe it, but finally, i remembered that mami and her husband talked to a man, and that man said they would follow me and made troubles every day one time at xizhimen of beijing, china. at that time, i thought it was not possible and did not take serious and forgot it. now, look back, it is true.”

i got involved when brother j kept sending her nice messages, alexa echo, and a samsung smartphone. he’s always been a con, wanted her to set it so he could drop in the video feed, sent instructions that led my grandmothers email linking to his devices. i changed all her passwords and went through all her bank and legal mail at her request, she has weird charges like 600$ at dollar general and way to many charges in one day. she doesn’t eat much so eating out 7 times in one day was odd. 

anyway grama told me something about giving j any info about her bank because the legal guys need tax payment in the estate or some excuse. she doesn’t understand legal things they have group meetings about so agrees to whatever they say. example: last meeting agreed to sell 600 of the 2700 of the estates shares in mcdonald’s to pay the property taxes... i added the property taxes up to at most few thousand. mcdonald’s per share sold for 183, that’s over $100k and i’ve seen nothing but what they said “taking it in cash... the rest will remain on the estate” 

any help please, she’s being scammed and won’t wrap her head around anything they or i am telling her"

"is my friend being scammed? my friend cancelled a contract at a fitness center due to disability. she paid a $50 cancellation fee and sent them proof of disability back in august. now today she was supposedly served by the center saying she owes them over $500. the papers don't have a phone number for our local courthouse, instead the number redirects to a collection's department which reiterated the need to be paid $500+ and that her proof of disability was ""aaa insufficient."" they are apparently saying they can reduce the cost down to $320 if she pays them by tonight. she's freaking out and i think she's being scammed.

i clicked today on an advertisement which was promising content like twitch, but with sexy nude girls. then it redirected me to a survey which was suspicious, but its visuals (pictures and videos in background) were very promising. on the page with credit card details, i filled the form and clicked. there weren't any ""checkboxes"" and it said that i will get three day trial for free to nude gamer. on the next page i was provided the information that i now have membership to three different sites - [member-premium.com](https://member-premium.com), [maxhdporn.com](https://maxhdporn.com), and [exclusiveadultvideos.com](https://exclusiveadultvideos.com). last two of them are not even working. the first one is a collection of random old porn, and it has a tiny section which is called nude gamer with up to 10 short videos. and, i received a mail that i'm a member to a camsite too - [liveadultchat.com/](http://www.liveadultchat.com/). and i noticed that there is a reservation for a payment of roughly €50 on my bank account."

"said yes to ""terms"" i got a call an hour ago claiming to be from optimum. the person was trying to promote some ""double play"" plan. i wasn't interested, but he was not taking my ""no"" and kept insisting that set up and demo is free and i can cancel anytime. he even said that the demo is gonna be after a week and i can cancel before that. i thought i can cancel it immediately after the call.

he asked me to confirm that i am fine with the terms. he said that the only thing i need to worry about was that taxes and fees might change. i said ""yes"" :(  
he had my address, he just asked me to confirm my zip code, i did that as well.

the number he gave me seems to be wrong. so i am trying to directly contact optimum to find out about this ( i am pretty sure its not from optimum, i cannot find this plan online)

"we've got hard cash but... we are almost 100% positive it's a scam. quick background:

my buddy is selling his bike in a local marketplace, $1700. they send him a cashier's check in the mail for more than asked for, saying that the extra is for the ""mover"" that they will send. 

once he cashes the check and has the money, they are asking him to send them money through various apps like venmo, or giftcards. super fishy right?

he said 500 through venmo because they said the mover wants the money up front. we have since told my buddy not to send anymore money.

it's almost definitely a scam, but how can they be making money off my friend if he already has the money?"

really lost because it does seem legit but i just want to make sure with it being craigslist and all.

"fake lawfirm - nodylaw scam fellow redditors,

for the sake of many website owners who have been receiving legal notices from a lawfirm called ""nodylaw"", i am posting this here just to let you know that it's a big scam. their fake lawfirm website is infected with malware, so don't click in unless you have antivirus enabled!!!!!!

this purported lawfirm sends out ""legal notices"" informing website owners that they have used stolen content which infringes on their client's rights, threatening a lawsuit if there is no response within 30 days upon receipt of the email.

i did some research on this ""nodylaw"" firm and it turns out that it doesn't exist at all in the usa (no valid bar license, no such attorney name, nothing). also, there are fake profile listings and reviews on the law firm which were created only a few days ago (such as medium and law networking sites)! their website is only created recently, even though they claim that they have been in practice since the 1980s. their nameservers have the word china in them with their ip address geolocated back to malaysia. pretty shady for a us firm eh?

also a simple whois search on their website will raise a tonne of red flags.

if you happen to receive any of these legal ""notices"" from nodylaw - do the right thing and send them back a \_l\_ with compliments

am posting this here so that people who search for nodylaw on google will come across this post and come to the same conclusions. hopefully this would save someone from doing something stupid like giving transfering money to them to ""settle"" the lawsuit.

don't fall for this bs! it is a fake lawfirm scam!

cheers"

"i am an offshore remote worker that got scammed i had worked for the company (or at least i think it is a company) since february 11, 2020, up until april 13, 2020, when all of a sudden the ""ceo"" deleted my access to the logins of intensitiwear shopify and social media profiles.

part of the reason why the ""ceo"" probably left me like this is that i no longer give attention to most of the tasks he gave me because i was looking for online remote work elsewhere that gives much better pay. 

we have agreed that i will be paid $150 for 80hrs/mo and $300 for 160hrs/mo. and it will be paid weekly: in my country, that amount of monthly salary is good if you are 1 person. 

sadly i live in a third world country which is poverty-stricken which i am also a victim too and i have to find ways to fund for my brother and sister for their schooling and hopefully pay the debts that we have over the years with my skill set as a graphics designer, seo, digital marketer.

in my case, the ""ceo"" gave me very little salary for too much work. 

my work varies from, daily market research, following competitors in social media platforms, doing all of the graphics, video and photo edits of various pictures that you are seeing now in the instagram pages, emailing leads, looking for affiliates such as yourselves and work from the shopify store. 

i understand that he is not getting sales from the short 2 months that i had worked for him probably because of covid-19 but i believe this is no reason for him to leave me like this.

1 month's worth of work was not paid for me (specifically between february 11 to february 14 which is 4 working days and from march 23 up until april 13 which is 16 working days which total up to 20 working days.

at first, i was very optimistic about the initial plan for his mental health campaign as i myself want to help support mental health causes like this.   
i told the ""ceo"" about partnering with other companies that support mental health but he declined the idea.  
in my own opinion, if we are supporting mental health-related campaigns, we should partner with a lot of people or businesses to boost that kind of awareness campaign."

(my dad is a gun guy and ex cop) i asked if he minded if i grabbed some paper and took notes. he did not mind. he said they got 3 ar15s full auto, a mg43 machine gun with an air-cool belt, 24 frag grenades, 1/2 a kilo of cocaine, 3 claymore mines, 4 sets of body armor, 3 sets of kevlar, 4 passports, and ""the other documents."" he said everything else is paid for but we still owe $1000 on the grenades and said they accept gold and mentioned some south african gold coin i didn't quite catch the name of. (a friend i talked to later said he probably said ""kruggerands."") the guys on the phone wanted to make a time to meet tomorrow at \[major street in my town\] before 5 pm, because ""they"" want to be out of town by then. they said they'd wear masks and gloves for the exchange and asked if my dad has been sick and i said no. i asked the man to spell my name and he spelled it correctly, and i asked how he got my name and number, and he just said i was listed as the secondary contact for the order, but he couldn't give me the primary person's name or number. he said his name is jericho and he is just the middle man, and i can call him back at that same number. i took notes under the pretense that this was legit and i'd have my dad call him back. he did mention the atf at one point and alluded to the crazy times we live in with the pandemic. i was like my dad wouldn't order cocaine, and he was like is he a big drinker, and i was like no, and he was like well you never know with some people. so what the fuck is this? legit doomsday peppers? not sure what they actually want! i thought maybe jericho was about to burst out laughing but he sounded professional the whole time. i haven't talked to my dad yet because it's late, and mainly i don't want my dad to be suspicious of me (he's already a suspicious guy) i just wanted internet strangers' opinions first. my friends all think it's a prank or a scam."

"weird scam took over computer control. this is a weird one. my girlfriend got the typical scam email today, threatening her yadda yadda yadda. but this one was weird because when she deleted the email, about 2 minutes later, her mouse started moving on its own in straight lines (laggy looking mouse movement, i figure it was a program maybe?), opening folders and finally opening chrome and moved the curser to the search bar. at this point, she turned off wifi and shut down the computer.

the seller was still available online up until yesterday evening, when he deleted his account. this, of course, deletes all of his correspondence along with it and now only shows the messages i've sent. i appreciate i was naive to trust someone online and have learnt my lesson the hard way, but if anyone has any recommendations of what to do next it would be greatly appreciated!

"[speculation] steam may have been compromised **declaimer:** i do not work for steam, nor am i a software engineer. this post is also not about sharing my sextortion email, but involves it. first time posting in this subreddit. if this violates any rules i may have missed, i apologies in advance.

like may others today, i too have received a sextortion email on my throwaway email; showing a password i haven't used for more than a decade. as a precaution i've started to update my password across multiple account, and for good measure, distance any account that uses that throwaway email. it only until i got to updating my steam account my blood froze a bit.

steam was using my throwaway email. and the password was using my decade old password.

while this does not definitively prove it, steam does seem like the most likely place the scammer could have gotten my (old) password and associating it with my throwaway email.

 i believe there is a strong possibility that the steam database may have been compromised.

regardless, i recommend everyone who uses steam to update their passwords as soon as possible."
"blackmail? my boyfriend and i are polyamorous. he sends nude pictures to other women all the time. he had been messaging this one for a while and then all of a sudden she sent a long paragraph saying something along the lines of ""i'm underage, send me $250"" and she sent his nudes back saying she'd report him. we know for a fact it was a female sending nudes but we dont know the age. this was all on snapchat and he instantly blocked her if that changes anything.  should i be worried about any legal action against him? i'm in iowa in the us.

"online pucimi furniture store - a scam? i was looking to purchase a specific loft bed online.  i found it from familiar stores for $250.00.  i then did a google-shopping search, which turned up [pucimi.com](https://pucimi.com), a furniture store supposedly from colorado.  they had it for $117.00 and free shipping.  that was my first red flag, but i continued to the shopping cart.  they only allowed payment via paypal even though there were mastercard and visa symbols all over the place.  that was my second red flag - time to start investigating.

here's where it gets interesting.  when i called the listed number, i was taken to rocky mountain pulmonary and critical care medicine - a colorado medical care company that seems to be legit.  the kicker is that the pucimi logo on the website actually looks like this: pucimi - pcm - pulmonary and critical care medice?  coincidence?

i talked to the woman at the pulmonary and critical care medicine.  she had never heard of pucimi.  but she did mention that she had gotten two other calls asking about furniture on the same day that i called.  she hadn't received such calls before that.

the pucimi website looks very professional, but when you start clicking on links, you realize there's no real content underneath.  for example, all of the facebook/twitter/etc links take you to the same generic ""email us"" page.

"got duped, feel like an idiot. psa inside. i guess a month in isolation really made my judgement poor. 

this goes without saying, **do not go for nintendo switch stuff on craigslist without meeting in person with cash in hand.** 

here's the story. browsing cl for a switch at a non ridiculous price, i stumble upon one near my area going for $350 and email via cl to see if it's available. it is! the price is over msrp, but not quite ridiculous so i then ask ""great, can we meet tomorrow at \_\_\_\_\_\_"" seller replies with the first red flag and where i should have just ended the conversation, ""oh i'm sorry i accidentally posted this in (my area), i'm currently in (another state) with my family waiting out the isolation"". 

by that point i should have stopped and i'm 150% sure anyone else would have. however my ""deal blindness"" resulted in me digging my own grave and asking if they're willing to ship if we go through a paypal invoice. they agree but come back with ""sorry i'm not set up on paypal, let me try"". 10 minutes later ""i can't hook my card or bank to paypal, i think i'll go a different route""......red flag #2. i then asked if there's another way, and they of course suggest apple cash, or qp...and at this point if anyone were around me they'd be screaming at me to stop right then and there. however i agreed because it was a good deal, so they sent me a en email to send the money via apple cash, i couldn't figure it out and got their number to which i did send the money and they informed me it will ship today, and arrive by thursday. 

great, i gave my address waited till about noon today, and nada. i asked how it's going with shipment and was assured they were on the way to ups, i said okay. seller was very responsive until about that point. all through cl email. four hours go by with nothing, so i emailed again to ask if it will ship today, and if not to cancel everything and give me my money back. guess what happens next. ghosted. bye bye $350. 

i did my research and i am aware that i am 100% sol. i luckily had money that i forgot i even had to recover the loss, but a net loss is a net loss. i spent a few hours reverse searching the phone number i paid to. i got some results with address, etc. i even found facebook profiles and stuff, but i don't even think there's a point in trying anything given that they're in another state, and my local pd likely will not pursue this if i file a report. 

**tl;dr - tried shipping a switch on craigslist, and ended up donating $350 to some scumbag in another state.** 

i am very aware of how stupid all of this was, and i am ashamed i fell for it. please learn from my mistake, especially considering there is a switch shortage right now and people are taking advantage of it. some look very tempting, and i unfortunately fell right for it. i have to say having never had this happen to me before, it was extremely stressful and gave me really bad anxiety."

i got a voicemail message saying i had a debt with them and they left a file number. i can’t think of anything that i would be in debt from but i was curious so i called them back with my dad there to make sure i was safe and not giving any personal info away unnecessarily. 

first time i called, we were on speakerphone, my dad gave the file number and then i took over from there. the guy asked who he was speaking to, so i told him and then asked if he was on speakerphone. i said yes, and we immediately heard a dial tone. (sketchy)

i still wanted to know what was up with this debt, so i called back, not on speakerphone. my dad was sitting next to me and could hear everything that was going on. gave the file number and my name, and the lady started asking if this was about my debt to _____. i couldn’t understand what she was saying so i kept saying that, and finally i said, i got a voicemail from you, i don’t know what this is about, can you explain? she proceeded to tell me about a debt to the ministry of the attorney (which should be the ministry of the attorney general if it’s legit). i asked what it was for and she said she wanted to verify my identity. my dad heard this and said no don’t, ask for a letter. so i asked her to send me a letter and when she asked for the address i said she should already have it. she then asked if it started with ___ and i said yes and that was the end of it. she also asked if she was on speakerphone because she could hear my dad talking and i said no there’s just someone beside me. 

sorry for the really long post but this just gave me major anxiety and i need to know what’s up with it"
my friend is about to send this person a screenshot of his bank account...what is the scam here? 
"chase fraud alert scam? hi, this may be a little silly, but i've been trying to get through to chase customer service for nearly 2 hours now, and i keep getting booted once someone picks up. 

i woke up this morning to a text alert stating the chase declined a charge from amazon prime, then asking to respond yes or no if i was the one behind the charge. i responded no, then received a text stating that they secured my account and are sending me a new card. i checked on apple pay, and it was updated with the details of a new card. i mentioned it to my parents, both of whom flipped out, demanding i call chase because clearly it's a scam (they think it's weird that i got issued a new card). i also received an e-mail about it, but didn't click anything on the e-mail, because it did look a little weird (i already sent this e-mail to [abuse@chase.com](mailto:abuse@chase.com) just in case). i also got a follow-up e-mail about my new card request. 

is this a scam?"
"amazon scam call i usually always order off of amazon and never received a confirmation call from them, until last night. i ordered things coming to a total of $270, about 20 minutes after my order i get a call from “scam likely” now, i don’t usually pick up these calls but i’m bored in quarantine. when i pick up, an indian voice is on the other end, greets me with my name and continues to mention that he’s calling from amazon, he then proceeds to ask if i ordered the items, he mentions what i specifically bought and mentions the total price, i say yes. i thought he was going to ask me for my email and password to verify something, i was going to play with him and give him the wrong credentials, unfortunately not, he continues to say “thank you, we called for confirmation, your order has been processed” i say “um, ok” and he hangs up. i contacted customer service, they said the call isn’t from amazon. i changed my password and set up 2 stop verification, i knew it was a scam from the jump but my question is, what did he get out of it ?"
i don't even have ig. did a quick google and multiple people report being confronted with 'fees' and never receiving products or payment. 
never used this password and i don't own a webcam. they really hope i'm that naive to fall for this.

the video first asks the user to change battery optimisation settings on his phone and then go to a website (appinject.cc in this case) and then download some files and a couple games/apps from the play store that you each then have to run 30 seconds. 

i assume it is not legit but what is the scam exactly? does it download malware, a keylogger perhaps? why are there so many of these videos on youtube and what can you do if you did go along with the instructions in the video?

hi so long story short i fell for a credit card scam the person told me that a check would be deposited to my account and then that i would have to cashapp them their money. i realized i was being scammed but not until after i cashapped the money already. the transaction was still pending (that was on friday it has since gone through as completed despite them freezing my account) so i contacted my bank and told them what happened and they locked my account and are planning to investigate it. the bank is dcu btw if that helps at all or if anyone has had an experience with the specifically with this type of situation. i already know that i fucked up and this was stupid but i'm trying to be hopefully since i contacted the bank within the same day and the overall transaction is still pending! any advice is more than helpful. i'm 19 and really scared and i feel like i am going to throw up. everyone is saying i’m going to have the pay the money back but is there anyone who avoided this somehow?"

"scammed via zelle/venmo hi,

it's difficult to admit that you are that dumbass who fell into a scam. this is my story.

i was just out of a divorce about 3 years ago and lost everything.  for my sanity, i left him everything!!! one year later, i met my bf.  one year after being together, he was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer.  i was desperate for money. i was already not in a good place financially, debt collectors were calling me and then the devil showed up.

an old junior high / high school friend came into my life again.  i remember him as a kind person but i guess you just never know these days.  he offered to help invest my money in gold overseas and to transfer a certain amount of money to an account overseas.  i was extremely hesitant at first and did not want to do it.  he was persistent and kept trying to convince me to do it.  my bf and i was not in a good place mentally ever since diagnosis so we decided to be hopeful instead.  maybe this could work.  

after $5000 of investment later, he is slowly disappearing.  now, i can't even get a hold of him at all. is there anything i can do to retrieve if not all, some of the money back from the bank? please help!

thank you so much!"

i purchased an item from an ad for a garden bed sent by fb. i completed the purchase and paid $143.00 with my credit card. since i have not received anything after several emails and a phone number that is full. i'm thinking i am a victim. does anyone know of qxwoo by best sellers? how to proceed? 
only accepts apple pay on ebay (never seen that before). seller also has zero reviews. scam? 
"airbnb listing job, is this a scam? i applied for a ""personal assistant"" job on craigslist that turned out to be listing airbnb properties for a company called mayfair estates. i tried doing research on the company, and they do have a website, but obviously anyone can. they have a physical address but again who knows if it is real. what stood out to me is that the email provider they use is tutanota, which doesn't seme normal for a regular company. my instructions are to join trello, and using a login they gave me on trello i must create airbnb ads with descriptions and photos provided. 

i am worried that this is a scam and i either will be doing legit work but i won't be paid or i am being duped into creating fake airbnb ads. maybe this has scam written all over it and i am just too blinded by the fact that i am financially hurting, i really don't know."
"scam mail, probably i got a mail from someone and mail was from outlook, which is kinda rare and i kinda pooped myself.

at first i was, ok, w.e, i dont even have a webcam, then i was thinking i had oculus rift couple months ago, and their sensors are, infact, a cheap webcams so yea.

but after reading some threads here i noticed they are all more or less the same, and they are being added automatically in a bulk by the bot so here it is.

"my girlfriend was scammed out of $1000usd, do we have any chance of ever seeing it again? this only just occurred two days ago when she called me in a panic saying that $1000 was paid to some shady account under the name facebk.virtual

turns out her details got stolen because a phishing email under the guise of paypal wanted to ""verify"" her details yada yada classic phishing ultimatum. literally just hours before her instagram account was trying to be accessed by someone in russia, so she thought her paypal was next.

i told her to call the credit card company to block it immediately the next morning when they could operate (due to the whole coronavirus lockdown). next morning they blocked it and she filed a dispute for the charges as well. although all she stated in the form was that it was an unauthorised purchase and listed it under fraud.

she's shaken up about it though, and is anxious if she should say everything as it happened because we're not sure if that could affect whether the dispute is accepted or not.

is there anything we can do/should or shouldnt say to the bank?

has this happened to anyone else before? did you get your money back in the end?

thanks."
someone reselling the thing i just sold them? i don’t know why this is making me crazy right now it’s just so weird. i sold someone a console for a fair price including games and about an hour later it was back on the facebook marketplace for basically the same price? i checked all the bills and they seemed real enough i’m just curious if anyone knows any scams out there that sound similar to this.

"trolling a scammer i got a scam email a while ago, the usual ""my husband died and left me a huge fortune, now i'm dying and want to give you all the money so you can help poor people"" bs. i did what anyone bored out of their minds thanks to the quarantine would do: reply and play along. 

right now i'm a guatemalan man with terrible english and borderline technology-illiterate. last thing i got from them is an email from a ""bank"" where the money is deposit, and i need to log in using the credentials they gave me, to transfer the money out to my own bank account. obviously i don't want to click on anything, but i was wondering what would happen? how does the scam work from here? is this as far as i could go or can i still keep trolling them somehow?

here's the email:

"orderhero with the virus still in full affect, i looked up google maps to see what small restaurants were open.  i saw the place that  i was looking for had pick up only and i also saw that i could order online and i did.  once i went to pick up my food the cashier asked me if i wanted to place an order, i said i already did online.  she replied, we don't do online orders.  long story short, i got scammed, scammed by orderhero. they even had the nerve to send me a text and asked me how was everything.  anyways i went into my bank account asap and cancelled my card and reported it."
"too good to be true so probably a scam? today i saw a nintendo switch on letgo for $190 and when i asked her why it was so cheap she said that given the current virus situation her hours got cut and she just needs some cash right now. i told her that's a good deal but currently it's a bit too high for me and she replied saying she could do for $100 and have it shipped to me (even though her location is around 10 minutes from me.)

 i told her i needed to test it first to make sure it's the real deal to which she replied that i can pay her $30 now through cashapp and she'll ship it to me then i can pay her the other $70 or i can return it. 

this all sounds way too good to be true but on the other hand if i try to think about the current situation of someone affected by the virus i guess it kind of makes sense? shipping to comply to social distance and making it cheap enough to get cash fast could make sense. also i've never been scammed before but i would think that $30 is an awfully low amount to go through such trouble"

i'm confused because they *had* the correct passcode to the account in question. i changed it later that day on a seperate device. i've been making sure any account that i have connected to that password gets the password changed. i'd like to know how they knew my password, and if i should be worried at all?"
"instagram scam so, i tried to purchase an account on instagram... i know.. ""why would you do that?"" but, i did.

the person who scammed me was **@ siimpstars** . he started by asking on his instagram  who wanted to buy his backup account (**@ siiimpstars**). i dm'd him and we struck a deal at **$100**. i was being careful already because i was unsure. i screen recorded our messages and the paypal payment. as soon as i sent him the money **he blocked me.** 

i then got on my second account and acted like i was interested in buying the account and he said he was still selling it. as soon as he got back to me i sent him the message saying i protected the paypal transaction and that if he did not refund me the money i would not only refund it myself, but report his instagram accounts and make sure action is taken. he read the message and it definitely scared him because he sent me back the money on paypal.

lesson here folks, is do **not trust** those on the internet.. as always.

i did not think i was going to get scammed because i had been in contact with this guy for a while and we sent messages back and forth, but clearly, it didn't mean anything to him.

what could i do to get this account into trouble? because i was not the only one who got scammed. he sent me a screenshot back and it showed a bunch of other paypal transactions he had received. this scum bag deserves to get a taste of his own medicine.

i have proof so just ask if you want me to show it."
"what’s the deal with the youtube affiliate marketing guys with lambos? i know you have probably seen those, “see how i went from nothing to this mansion” commercials. it is always a guy taking about how to be rich. i think his idea is affiliate marketing. thoughts?"
"i can't stop getting chinese robocalls about once every 3-4 weeks i get a chinese robocall. this has been going on since november of last year. i don't know how this happened, i've had this phone number for 7 years and i've never had a problem with robocalls in the past like this. i'm not even chinese or of asian descent. 

the robocall is usually the same thing. i don't know mandarin but after getting them a few times, i started to ask a few people i know who do speak chinese if they could translate it for me. some calls say they're the chinese embassy, some just say to call back it's urgent, and some just play piano music with no dialogue. the piano music one is the creepiest. they all call from different numbers from a chicago area code. 

my guess is that someone either used my phone number or miss wrote their own phone number that happened to be similar to mine to sign up for something. i don't normally sign up for things using my phone number and if i do, it's something i know i can trust. 

any suggestions on how to prevent or stop this?"

"pension benefit information, llc i received a letter from this organization, supposedly on behalf of a former employer. they're tracking down 'missing' employees that are owed benefits. my rational brain says i only worked for the employer for two months and don't believe any benefits were activated during that time. i also left there eight years ago. and have moved twice since, but they have my current address and it is a legit former employer. scam? maybe actual lost monies?"

"is this buyer on ebay trying to scam me? i listed a laptop for sale earlier today, and someone has offered me $94 more than the buy it now price i listed to purchase it.  they sent me this message: ""kindly accept my offer and text me your paypal email address to my cell number [redacted] or my email address [redacted] to proceed with the payment asap"".

i could use the extra money but i feel like this has to be a scam.  why would anyone ever offer more than the asking price except to entice someone to fall into a scam?  the account is listed as being from 2010, has 65 followers, and and has 100% positive feedback over 29 reviews, but they've set reviews to private so i can't tell if they're legitimate reviews or not.  
i've never sold anything on ebay before, only purchased some things, so i don't know entirely how it works, but i think buyers are supposed to purchase through ebay.

what happens if i accept the offer but don't message them outside ebay, so everything has to stay on the platform?  do they then have to pay what they offered through ebay?  i feel the only way i could accept payment outside of ebay is if they paid me in bitcoin, because something through paypal could be disputed but with bitcoin, once the money is sent it's gone and he couldn't fraudulently recover it and abscond with my money and my computer."

"police &amp; facebook won't do anything about scammer my sister was looking for a bed on facebook and found someone that was selling one for $320. the person claims that the beds are built to order and requires a $180 deposit upfront. unfortunately my sister sent the money and never heard back from him. he's continuing to do this and it seems like he chooses to only take advantage of women since my male friend messaged him and he didn't reply, but he replied to my other sister right away.

the police won't do anything and neither will facebook. this person is taking advantage of people in a pretty delicate point in time for a lot of people.

does anyone have any ideas of what we can do?

thanks!"

due to the covid-19 pandemic my wife and i won’t be able to look at places in person before we move across the county. i found a listing on zillow that only has the street instead of the full address.
i messaged the property manager and he texted me, he said we could do a facetime walkthrough. i asked if he would be willing to accept a deposit and hold the place for us until we are able to move in and we would pay the prorated amount for may. he agreed and said we could venmo the deposit to them if we pass the application process."

context: i do not recall having visited any pornsite lately. i don't even watch porn using any account, i use pornhub for free. also, my webcam is covered 98% percent of the time. the weird thing is the password they mentioned is something relevant to me since it's a password i used to use years ago and the password is a number relevant in my life. also, i received this in one of my old emails... it's a hotmail account! so i really don't know what to do.  


how should i proceed about this? any tips? is this real? fake?"
how can i make sure 100% that an email is legitimate 
"scammed out of $2k during desperate coronavirus apartment hunt i need to move asap! i found the perfect apartment through craigslist \[edit: i realized it was zillow going through my records!\] and began emailing with the exchanged emails with the “certified property manager” “donald”. he sent me a copy of his property manager certificate and driver’s license. he also gave me his california department of real estate license number. all the info checked out and looked legit. here’s his website: [www.dfernandezapartmenthomes.com](http://www.dfernandezapartmenthomes.com/)

he sent me pictures of the apartment and a rental agreement that included the terms that everything was refundable if the unit wasn’t exactly as pictured. given current conditions with the coronavirus, i made the mistake of assuming this was a legitimate way of conducting business.

i sent “the building owner” (“tina”) the deposit and rent, totaling $2275, through zelle.

donald and i established that we would meet this morning for him to give me the keys.

well, this morning at 10am, he wasn’t there.

i called him 3 times and when i finally got through he said he was running 25 to 30 minutes late. i got angry at him on the phone for not letting me know and he hung up on me. when i called back, i got the message “the number you are trying to reach is no longer in service”

i dialed up other residences from the apartment call box and reached one who told me **other victims of this scammer had shown up at the apartment before.**

i called the police and filed a report with them. they told me the driver’s license number and his name do not match up. upon visiting the apartment they told a resident to call them if someone else shows up who has fallen for the scam. they left a message for donald threatening him with the charge of grand theft and telling him to return the money immediately

now that i am digging around, i’ve found that “donald” seems to have used a text now phone number rather than a legitimate phone number.

i had ""the owner's"" bank info, so i called wells fargo to notify them that the account holder was committing fraud and gave them the police number.

i don’t know why his other victims didn’t file a report, but i did!  and i refuse to rest until i do everything in my power to stop this guy and get my money back.

&amp;#x200b;

edit: i called the domain host of his website and explained the story to a representative. the rep had me report the site as phishing and targeting [apartmenthomes.com](https://apartmenthomes.com)

edit 2: reverse image search found this site [http://www.dreamhomergv.com/](http://www.dreamhomergv.com/) and a different identity ""leonel"""

"have i been scammed? i attempted to buy a ps4 pro from someone over letgo. due to covid19, he wanted to ship it to me rather than meet in person. he asked for payment over cashapp and suggested that he would send the usps tracking number at the same time i sent the money. i never sent money, but he did ask for my name, number, and address for shipping purposes. it’s been over a day and every time i try to message him i get an error message. i didn’t pay him, but was this a scam to get my personal info?"
"airbnb deletes bad reviews long story short: my family came to visit me in minneapolis and they chose to stay at an airbnb apartment building, rated close to 5 stars. this building is in the university/medical area and hosts students and residents normally with year long contracts. the few apartments they don’t rent to students are listed on airbnb. 
when my family arrived the sheaths were dirty and the pillows had hair on them. i helped them changing the sheaths for towels and other clean stuff they had in their luggage including t shirts, shirts etc just in order to be able to spend the night. we called immediately the company that was renting the apartment and airbnb. they promised they would come the next morning. needless to say they never showed up. so the second night i brought them a set of my sheaths and pillow cases. the second morning my dad woke up with bites all over his forehead:bed bugs. my dad lost his mind and i was furious. i only get to see my family once or twice a year and something like this just destroys the morale. i called again airbnb and the landlord. we had the bruises examined by a healthcare provider who wrote a not saying it was bed bugs, there was blood on the sheaths and evidence of bites. also when the exterminator came they day after the landlord texted my brother saying he found evidence of bed bugs. anyways they now needed to move from there and they were relocated in a different unit in the same building. the catch was that they could only spend 1 night there because the day after it was rented to another customer. so they spent the night and we had to figure out by ourselves where to spend the night after. also, initially, airbnb offered to refund only the nights they would have not spent in the building so they would have had to pay for the first 3 nights. at that point i lost my mind. i literally spent over 10 hours on the phone with airbnb customer service over the next 3 days fighting to get back everything to the last dime. i won’t lie i really wanted a bloody revenge and i was ready to go all the way with lawyers etc. at the end they agreed to reimburse the full amount and pay on top of that a daily amount of 60ish bucks for every day they had left in minneapolis. i took the offer because i was exhausted. finally, to the point: i left through my brother’s account a raging review describing the story how i described it here. today i go back to check if it’s there out of curiosity and it’s gone. only 5 stars reviews. on top of that the daily rent has gone up almost 100% too. i go on google reviews and it’s rated 5 stars by 4 reviewers and the one review that is one star says: “beware they are deleting bad reviews here”.
there is much more to the story.just know that the administration of that building, not only the airbnb dedicated units but the whole thing is really shady, however this is long enough without too many details, but i’m happy to answer questions if you have any!"
"job offer feels like a scam i got a job offer from a recruiting agency in alberta called bq international ltd for a position they wanted me to apply for at a company called farm credit canada. they reached out to me via linkedin and the position is relavent to what i'm currently doing. 

as soon as i emailed them my resume and references, the agent called me for a brief interview and told me about the job. the interview was just vague information on the job and one question on what kind of role i'd like to do at the company. what shocked me was when he told me the amount, which is nearly triple what i make currently. even more suspicious was that he asked me what i'd like to make and first and offered me double that. 

it seemed way to good to be true, but the only question he asked me that could be deemed a security risk (besides providing my resume with my contact number) was for my date of birth, not including year though.

after the interview was over, he asked if it was ok to share my profile with the client and gave me some tips on how i could change my resume to make it more relevant to the position. i sent him the updated copy and immediately went searching for info on both the companies, but haven't found anything about it that shows its a scam. the only thing i find kinda suspicious is the fact that according to their linkedin page, bq international ltd has between 2-10 employees which is pretty small considering its a recruiting agency.

please let me know what you guys think about this or if you can point me in the direction of a better place to ask this question. for reference, i'm currently working at ibm as a service desk agent making $16/hr while they're offering $40/hr for what essentially is the same role."

"the ‘high value item return scam’ i couldn’t see this scam in the master list. not sure if i missed it on the list, if so apologies in advance. recently, however, i have seen stories of this scam crop up more and more often on other subs. there are definitely variations of it, but it involves the victim ordering an item from “company a” the victim not receiving the correct item and company a refusing to refund the victim claiming the correct item was delivered. 

here’s the scam (used gbp as it’s my local currency, could happen anywhere, though):

the scammer goes and buys some company a gift cards using cash. they get quite a few, £1150 in total. to not raise suspicions they visit a few retailers to buy these. they open a new company a account, likely with a fake name and address and add the gift cards. they then order a brand new iphone 11 pro max in silver to a company a locker. when the iphone 11 arrives they carefully open the box, take out the phone and replace it with an older phone, (say a faulty iphone 6 from ebay) and then covertly add some blue-tack in the box if necessary to make sure it weighs the same as the original box did. they then reseal the box with shrink wrap and send it back to company a claiming that they accidentally bought silver and actually wanted midnight green. when company a receive the box they see it’s sealed, weigh it and x-ray it. (apparently the x-ray part is unusual but if they do it, they’ll see a phone and the image won’t be good enough to see what type of phone.) everything looks good to company a so they put it back in their stockroom to be resold and send out the midnight green version to the scammer, again to the company a locker.

meanwhile, the scammer sells the silver iphone privately, making sure to only offer delivery and only accept cash. it’s probably a reasonably local sale. they might sell it a bit cheaper, so maybe £1000 instead of £1150. (this is actually a scam in itself, because that phone will likely be deactivated further down the line... but we’ll come to that...)

when the scammer eventually receives the midnight green iphone they sell that one on in the same manner. we’ll say they sell that one for £1000 as well. let’s take off £50 for expenses - old broken iphone 6, shrink wrap, travel etc. even then the scammer has made £800. they could easily do that with two phones at a time, that’s £1600.

and keep swapping the sim card and phone they make the scam account from and the locker they use and they can do it over and over.

of course all this means that there are iphone 11 pro boxes in company a’s warehouse that have old faulty iphones in them.

so of course, the primary victim orders an iphone 11 pro and receives a faulty iphone 6. the victim contacts company a who, as far as they are concerned delivered the correct item and the victim is the scammer. as such company a will refuse to issue the refund.

the second victim is the one who bought the silver iphone because it will be deactivated if company a or the victim report it stolen.

i’m not really sure how this can be fully avoided, short of not buying high value items from company a. but if you haven’t come across this before, definitely something to be aware of.

there are several posts on other subs about this happening, but i am unsure what the rules on linking other posts are..."

over the past few weeks they've been receiving emails from various loan companies trying to either verify a sign up or give notice of a loan being approved or that they ""only have one step left to get the loan"" or whatever. the person the emails are all addressed to is no one that we know, but they have the same last name as us. the email does not have our last name in it. none of the emails were ever read or replied to. i've since gone through and marked about 40 of them as spam and unsubscribed from the companies.


however, they received a letter in the mail addressed to this person from one of these companies. this really freaked my parents out and now they're afraid their identity might be stolen if this person has the email and home address.

today, i get a text from paypal saying i had made a purchase of $126. i log on immediately and see it’s for some russian fps game. i didn’t make that purchase and i try to dispute it with paypal and i get an email back saying my claim was denied. they’re telling me i must have made this purchase! their staff is gone bc of covid so i’m not getting any help from them.

i spotted dozens of these posts from different accounts in the replies of celebrity tweets. it looks like they used bots to gain traction as when i looked through the accounts that liked the tweet they were all inactive for over several years and seemed to be just randomly liking pictures. they also all had strange characters in their user names that messed up the browser. it's likely they are running their own botnet or buying the likes from websites like [these](https://www.redsocial.net/buy-twitter-likes/).

not big amount of btc to un­lock.
but i look­ed at the sites that you regula­rly visit, and 
i was sh­ocked by what i s­aw!!!
i'm talk you about sites for adu­lts.

i want to say - you ar­e a big pervert. your fantasy is 
shi­fted far away from the normal c­ourse!

an­d i got an idea....
i made a scre­enshot of the adult sites where you have fun 
(do you unders­tand what it is about, huh?).
after that, i made a scree­nshot of your joys (using the 
camera of your device) and glue­d them together.
turned out amazing! you are so spect­acular!

i'm know that you wo­uld not like to show these scre­enshots 
to your frie­nds, relatives or colleag­ues.
i think $785 is a very, very small amount f­or my silence.
besides, i have be­en spyi­ng on you for so long, having spent 
a lot of ti­me!

pay only in bit­coins!
my btc wallet: 1mszw1rqv3eedz7tatu2mw7tyfsvsx9hfo

you do not know ho­w to use bit­coins?
enter a query in any search engine: 
""how to replenish btc wal­let"".
it's extremely eas­y

for this pa­yment i give you two days (48 hours).
as soon as this letter is op­ened, the timer will work.

after pay­ment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your 
enjoys will be self-destruct au­tomatically.
if i do not receive from you the sp­ecified amount, 
then your devi­ce will 
be locked, and all your con­tacts will receive a screenshots 
with your ""en­joys"".

i hope you under­stand your situation.
- do not try to find and destro­y my virus! (all your data, 
files and scr­eenshots is already uploaded to a remo­te server)
- do not try to co­ntact me (you yourself will see that this is 
imposs­ible, i sent you an email from your account)
- various sec­urity services will not help you; formatting 
a disk or destroying a devi­ce will not help, since your data is 
already on a remote server.

p.s. you are not m­y single victim. so, i guarantee you that i will 
not disturb you ag­ain after pay­ment!
this is the word of honor hac­ker.

i also ask you to regula­rly update your antiv­iruses in the future.
this way you wi­ll no longer fall into a similar situa­tion.

do not ho­ld evil! i just do my job."

"was sextorted a while ago, paid once, ended up changing my phone number and disabling social media accounts, but can’t get rid of the stress in january this year someone catfished me, screenshotted our grindr conversations, posted them to youtube, facebook and instagram, then sent me links and named my family members, long story short, i got scared and ended up paying 75$, biggest mistake of my life, i know.

about a month later they came back, i blocked them, and two weeks later they came back again, this time i changed my phone number, my instagram was already private at this time, then after a month, i finally calmed down a little i suddenly get a weird follow request from a new account with a vague female profile picture, i deny the request, but freak out, knowing its the scammers.

 so i deactivate my account, and move to youtube, where an author, frank m. ahearn is talking about sextortion, and he says that the worst thing you can do is change your number and ignore scammers, but thats exactly what i did, and what i thought i was supposed to do, is it not?"
what kind of scam is this. i knew it was a scam from the start but i was curious so i kept messaging. she gave me the number to citizens bank (i googled the number) and the account + pin to check her balance and the automated system said $34 million. what is she trying to do?

"beware of caluanie scams (the chemical that everyone especially in mongolia is looking for) i just do not want anyone else to be depressed and feel suicidal like me. hello,  
first of all, this is my first reddit post. i think i should give you a little bit info about myself. i live in mongolia and have 2 kids, lovely wife. that is all. now, i am suicidal and depressed.   


mongolia is really poor country. paying apartment loan, salary loan, feeding my family, working under stress and low salary have always made me mad but i have always loved my family and cared for them no matter how hard everything is out there. i went to college in the us by government scholarship, i was born in poor family but i thought this was my beginning of wealthy life that i dreamed of. i had a dream. now, i am just walking corpse when i am at work or outside without my family.   
recently (like 4 or 5 months ago), i heard from my friend that i can sell the chemical mentioned above for really high amount. then i searched for it thoroughly, contacted many of them sellers, and found one that i considered reliable. they sent me video with my name and date on paper next to it. everything was good. i sent 3000 usd for the amount of 1l. i had to take another loan for that. btw, i didn't and still don't know about the chemical like what it is used for etc. but i knew just something like it can break iron etc (there is bunch of youtube videos). now i don't know if this thing exists or not. it feels like it has been mystery.   


however, later they said they can't send that amount here and asked for more money for minimum amount of shipment. i contacted them for like 2 months until i transferred the 3k. i got mad and told the truth i don't have another 3k. also, i gave them offer they can benefit more than they can imagine if they pay for the other 3k. then like another 2 months, they have been giving me hope of they will come to me, talking about corona sucks etc. (whole thing is a long story). after all, i just gave up and wanted my money back, but he said i can get my money back or he can come here if i pay another 3k. all turned into bullshit, i think he gave up too for scamming another 3k.   


there is just no easy money. play stupid games, win stupid prizes.   


i still cannot believe how stupid i can be. i now clearly understand the meaning of money makes you blind. i still have to pay like 6k (18mil mnt) usd leftover to the guy who sold me the apartment by the end of this year and about 8k (20mil mnt) usd i borrowed from my boss for my dad's liver cancer 2 years ago (my bosses are truly good people and not asking me to pay asap. i owe them many things that i have not mentioned here and i try to do my job flawlessly, i would not have survived until here without them in this shitty country, yes, shitty country). i know, i know, it sounds fucked up or unbelievable and my life is a mess. and i keep making mess.  


all i ever dream is to have enough money that my kids never have to go through the same path as mine. with this growing population, technology, market, i always feel that they even have to try harder than me to survive in harder competition when they are adults.  trying hard, studying hard, and working hard to survive is not just one wouldn't want. we are not robots. everyone is expecting you to become wealthy and all cuz you graduated school in the us, then there i am always asking from my poor parents and sometimes sisters for money like a parasite (cuz all the money i get on my hands is about 90 usd/month at the best and this just minus apartment loan and salary loan). btw, my wife graduated medical school and haven't started working yet cuz of pregnancy and taking care of my sons. even if she works, she has to work without salary for first 2 years. plus, salary for doctors in mongolia is joke. this is not how i imagined my life to be. i tried to make some little business and failed few times.   


i am a mess. i tried to commit suicide when i am in high school. sorry, mom and dad. i have always been useless no matter how hard i try but you have been always proud of me and loved me the most.   


and i know my wife probably will be the fucked up most if i kill myself. she worries the most and takes care of me 24/7 when i get sick even if it means no sleeping at all (yes, she overdo it). one time i kinda joked about killing myself and she cried pretty long. i realized that i said the worst fucking thing especially when she was pregnant. you are my everything. and tears are just coming out from my eyes as i am typing this right now.   


but i am giving up, losing hope, wearing out, beginning to not care about being selfish. putting bag on my head tightly taped, helium pumping. feel like not failing and nothing is helping me this time. i know that i shouldn't be doing this but pain inside is just too much and it is getting out of hand. i wish i was never been born at all. i feel bad for having kids for giving them possibly worse future than mine. i am sorry everyone. just wanted to share what i think at this moment (could be my last or maybe not), though i have never even posted single post (my words) on social media likes for last few years. i am not afraid to tell everyone now. i don't care who sees this now or if no one sees."
"victim of sextortion hi guys, i’m a teenager that recently got involved in an act of sextortion. someone friended me on facebook that i didn’t know, but had mutual friends with me, so i accepted. a few days afterward, they started messaging me. it was some simple small talk and then they got more risqué. they eventually got on a video call and this “girl” started taking their clothes off. i guess i was too caught in the moment and started wanking it on camera. they closed the call after a few minutes. after that, the sent screenshots from the call of me. i have no idea if they recorded it, but i knew it was a high possibility. they then said they would make my life a living hell and then started sending links of my family members on facebook. i was so petrified and i blocked them as fast as i could. my privacy settings got even more maxed out after that too. i can’t believe i actually was thinking with my dick. i’m smarter than this. it’s been about 2 weeks and nothing has happened. should i still worry about this? i don’t want my future ruined because of this. i’m so scared."

address/name/occupation/sex/age/id
so i responded to the email he sent me requesting that, saying that i doubted him. then, he made about a 5 paragraph email reply to my reply, saying he’s genuine and shit. on top of that, he sent me about 7 photos of strangers id numbers, and people taking selfies of themselves holding up a picture saying “thank you richard wahl”., and he also sent me his passport. so. what the heck is this? is this a master plan to scam people? or is it genuine? thanks."

"tinder scam: tinder messenger searching this subreddit for ""tinder messenger"" gets nothing, so decided to make a post here detailing it.

the romance scam ""tinder messenger"" is actually really good at hiding the fact it is a scam.  it's one of those verification sites that subscribes you to other websites for other things that charge your credit card ludicrous amounts of money.  you have your ""free trial"" for x days, usually two, but cancelling the trial takes at least two days, meaning the trial ends, you get charged, and you can't dispute it.  it also tanks your credit score (assuming you had one; i don't, from debit card exclusivity usage).

the website like many verification sites is actually rather smart code.  it can detect your debit card and auto-decline the transaction.

now ""tinder messenger"" looks very legit.  custom high posh website.  uses the tinder trademarks (probably illegally), links to various legit tinder pages, etc.  doesn't show the ubiquitous disclaimer you will be signed up for other stuff.

make no mistake, it is a scam.  'view-source:' is such a handy tool to figuring it out.  in the source code for the website is a link to a different website using the same verification sign up but with the actual sign up disclaimer and nothing else besides the phishing interface and the disclaimer."

this is now day 2 since the request for money and none of the images have been posted. i got a message on my phone from a person who didn’t speak the best english asking me “do i want to put an end to this shit”.

it’s out of my control what they do with the chat images. in all honesty if they post it at this point i’m just going to accept it. i’ve warned the people i care about that my information has been compromised and not to open messages from unknown people.

"covid-19 cybercriminal work-from-home wi-fi router scam just received this notice from our chief it security information officer, so thought i would share.

**summary:**

cybercriminals are continuing to find new ways to exploit the current covid-19 crisis. with so many people working from home, attackers have been observed targeting home wi-fi routers to send victims to malicious covid-19 websites. 

**analysis:**

&amp;#x200b;

* cybercriminals are brute-force attacking router passwords to gain admin access. to do this, they are exploiting weak or default passwords.
* once a device has been compromised, they are configuring the router to send victims to malicious websites (referred to as dns hijacking).
* victims are being rerouted to a bogus world health organization (who) page to download a covid-19 application as seen below:

&amp;#x200b;

* rerouting to this download link occurs when the victim  attempts to go to one of the following websites: 

&amp;#x200b;

* aws.amazon.com
* goo.gl 
* bit.ly
* washington.edu
* imageshack.us
* ufl.edu
* disney.com
* cox.net
* xhamster.com
* pubads.g.doubleclick.net
* tidd.ly
* redditblog.com
* fiddler2.com
* winimage.com

&amp;#x200b;

* the malware, if installed, will connect to a remote server and steal data from the victim’s computer. 
* the most common routers being exploited are **linksys** and **d-link**.

**what can i do?** 

&amp;#x200b;

* proactive steps:

if you have not done so already, change the default password to your router. **note: this is** **not** **your wi-fi network password**. the username and password that are being exploited is on the router itself. in order to change the router default admin password, refer to the owners’ manual of your specific router. 

* ensure your router password is strong by using a combination of upper case, lower case, numbers and special characters, and we recommend that your password is at least 15 characters long. 
* **do not** use the password that  you use at work. 

&amp;#x200b;

* reactive steps:

&amp;#x200b;

* if you have already fallen victim, immediately turn  off your router to stop data from being stolen from your computer. 
* call your it security dept. or it help desk immediately to report the attack."

"publishing scam?? hi!  tonight while i was surfing the web i got a ""private"" invitation to a webinar about ghost audio. the term was unfamiliar but interesting so i opted into the webinar. it was one of a set of twins and in short, was telling about their new and improved 2.0 class at their aia, audiobook income academy. after letting the webinar run while i made dinner and then took notes, it was 2 1/2 hours before you finally find out they want $997 for their 2.0 class which lasts 6 weeks and in which they say they'll be there with you every step of the way with simple steps that if followed to the letter will result in revenue up to $40k a month from publishing audiobooks, e-books and printed books. they give you all you need such as ghost writers, artists for book cover, narrators and who to send to for publishing. $9,255 value for $997 but only for the next 24 hours. of course they explain that you must work hard and be patient because it takes time to build up to that kind of income, but a possible $1k to $6k in 3 months is not an exaggeration.

i tried checking them out but everything i found seemed to be put there by them. the only things by anyone else was all the videos of people singing their praises. they have a fb page and at least one of them is on linkedin, but again the only things there seem to be of their making.

i don't know anything about the publishing business but my daddy used to tell me ""if it sounds too good to be true...""  well, you know the saying too so i thought i'd come here and see if anybody knew of them or their academy.  oh yes, they also have a number of videos on youtube also. what do you think....scam???? they are christian and rasmus mikkelsen."

"is nationalvininfo.com a scam or fake website? a buyer on craigslist texted me saying he is very interested in my car and set up a time to meet and look at the car the next day. he then says he wants to see a history report and suggests nationalvininfo.com because it is cheaper than carfax. i said i was not comfortable and could pay for a autocheck report. i then bought the report and sent him the pdf to a email he told me to send it to. it has been a day and i have not heard back since so i figure it is. has anyone else experienced a buying suggesting nationalvininfo website? has it worked for you or is it a scam?

"got scammed by a student loan consolidation scam i can't believe it but i've been scammed by amerifeddocprep, a company that claims student loan consolidation &amp; payment reduction.

 one of my fellow classmates mentioned to me that you can get your loans consolidated and i remember i got a couple letters back in october saying i should be eligible for loan consolidation. so i decide to give them a call to see what the deal was. he sounded legitimate and he knew information about my quantity of my loans and so i thought he was associated with the department of education, or whoever the fuck issued my loans. i'm pretty sure he was accessing my fsa id because he asked to verify my security questions (one of which i got wrong) and he said that he could skip that step with my social security number. i hesitated because i know that i should never give out my ssn but i figured he was legitimate and told him. eventually he started talking about the document preparation fees being around $899 and i was like wtf. he said the loans would be consolidated into payments of $39/month for 240 months (20 years) to which the rest would be forgiven afterwards (which did not make sense). i told him i didn't want to be in debt that long and would want to put more down when i eventually make higher incomes. it all seemed so suspect at this point and so i told him no i had to do some research first. he texted me a separate number to reach out to him if i wanted to proceed. 

i looked over the original letter sent to me and it is just so scammy, the name of the business isn't even clearly defined on the letter. i called him back to see where i could view the information online and at first he told me the department of education website and i was like no, i need your website, to which he told me and then texted me amerifeddocprep.com, which screams scam to me.

 i am glad i didn't agree to any paperwork or any payments to their company but i am so fucking worried right now. the scammer has my name, address, dob, and ssn. i already put out credit freezes and fraud alerts on the three credit reporting agencies, which was almost directly after i realized my fuck up. going to reach out to my bank when they open their lines tomorrow morning and file a police report. what else should i do?"
"am i in danger or is this a scam? recently, i was contacted by an international number regarding someone i had blocked on my social media. he said something roughly along the lines of “you’ll get what you deserve for what you did to my brother.” he claimed that he was involved in cybercrime and in 10-15 days i would regret what i did. 

out of fear, i contacted the police in case i was in danger. they said it was most likely a scam. 

i found it odd. i’d expect scams to ask for money or some form of payment. should i be concerned? or am i just paranoid?"

"i feel stupid asking but is this email threat fake? usually i ignore scams, but this one might have merit, and i'm freaking out. please help.

i had an email with this as the body of text:

\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

 i know, \[redacted\], is your password. you don't know me and you're thinking why you received this e mail, right?   
 

well, i actually placed a malware on the porn website and guess what,  you visited this web site to have fun (you know what i mean). while you  were watching the video, your web browser acted as a rdp (remote  desktop) and a keylogger which provided me access  to your display screen and webcam. right after that, my software  gathered all your contacts from your messenger, facebook account, and  email account.   
 

what exactly did i do?   
 

i made a split-screen video. first part recorded the video you were  viewing (you've got a fine taste haha), and next part recorded your  webcam (yep! it's you doing nasty things!).   
 

what should you do?   
 

well, i believe, $1900 is a fair price for our little secret. you'll  make the payment via bitcoin to the below address (if you don't know  this, search ""how to buy bitcoin"" in google).   
 

btc address:   
 bc1qs606g24jw32y6ryj3jwttzkhgpax0uamdvc29x   
 (it is case sensitive, so copy and paste it)   
 

important:   
 

you have 24 hours in order to make the payment. (i have an unique pixel  within this email message, and right now i know that you have read this  email). if i don't get the payment, i will send your video to all of  your contacts including relatives, coworkers,  and so forth. nonetheless, if i do get paid, i will erase the video  immidiately. if you want evidence, reply with ""yes!"" and i will send  your video recording to your 5 friends. this is a non-negotiable offer,  so don't waste my time and yours by replying to  this email.

**things i noticed:**

that's not my password for anything. it's just a random string of numbers. i don't know why i redacted it, i can't think of any use of that string of numbers. i'm just extra cautious right now. 

if this 'keely' had indeed placed a keylogger, why isn't he/she/they having a party with my bank account and social media accounts? 

chrome requires a special extension to act as an rdp

i have been using rdp and webcams in my work from home situation (office job.)

i'm not afraid to admit i did use a porn site but i am sure my webcam was unplugged, as i always do after my calls. even if i forgot, i'm 90% sure i would have seen the blue light on the webcam. the laptop webcam doesn't work.

i searched the bitcoin address and found a 3 reports (probably more now) each with a different abuser name and address. either this is a group of hackers or just a new scam email random scammers are employing? using the same bitcoin address.

bit of a contradiction in the final statement. reply with !yes for proof. but don't was both our time replying. what?

i immediately installed malwarebytes and scanned. it's a free trial premium edition and it only found 1 entry, pup.optional.installcore, which is just standard ad aware. saying that, the malware could be sophisticated and hidden.

please help i am freaking out"

i told him to turn it off until i can figure out what he needs to do.

my thoughts for the computer itself are to turn it on where there's no wifi for it to connect to so i can save his photos and files to a thumb drive and then reset it to factory settings and install windows defender.

also told him to be wary of other scams as they might share his info.

"shaw academy warning many of you have probably seen ads for shaw academy going around on social media for a free 4 week trial. please do not join the site. they are a scam.

shaw academy is an online learning platform based in ireland founded by james egan and adrian murphy. the courses are a scam.

they lure in victims with promises of a “free” 4 week trial course, where they then make multiple unauthorised “credit check” charges.

the site contains multiple pop-up ads placed in locations where you accidentally click on, where they will also charge you an additional $34.95 for a ""toolkit"". there is no warning or confirmation of purchase.

"shaw academy warning many of you have probably seen ads for shaw academy going around on social media for a free 4 week trial. please do not join the site. they are a scam.

shaw academy is an online learning platform based in ireland founded by james egan and adrian murphy. (board members https://www.shawacademy.com/about/). the courses are a scam.

they lure in victims with promises of a “free” 4 week trial course, where they then make multiple unauthorised “credit check” charges.

the site contains multiple pop-up ads placed in locations where you accidentally click on, where they will also charge you an additional $34.95 for a ""toolkit"". there is no warning or confirmation of purchase.

there is also absolutely no transparency on cancellation of membership. they continue to charge a monthly subscription fee because members are unable to cancel. multiple members of the community have been charged an insane amount of money for ""subscription fees"" despite cancelling their accounts before their free trial ended.

this company is dishonest, immoral scammers who are taking advantage of honest people who are just trying to learn a new skill during these financially unstable times. please support me in shutting down this illegal business.

"bernese mountain dog scam! do not buy puppies from this place!
[puppy scam](https://www.majestic-berners.com/)

     my family just went through an awful ordeal with majestic-berners. we lost our 2 family dogs of 14 years one month apart in early 2020. we miss having fur babies &amp; were excited to find bmd puppies available! we contacted majestic-berners and asked about the puppies. videos + pictures of rico, maggie, and marve were sent by email (we picked rico &amp; maggie), papers were signed electronically, payments were made, and we were set! my dad bought new toys &amp; food, my sister cleaned the dog bed, and my mom puppy-proofed the house. 

     we were told that the puppies could be sent by plane so we didn't have to drive 10 hours to get them. we didn't like the idea, but with covid-19 and stay-at-home orders we didn't want to cross 4 states. we were assured by the breeder that they did this all the time and there would be an escort with them in the cabin, not cargo. they guaranteed the puppies will arrive in under 24 hours. so we agree and we got a message saying that the puppies were at the ""shipping agency"" (united pet carriers) with delta airlines. a tracking number was sent to us, but the tracker showed that the puppies were delayed and they might need to be over-nighted! the tracking number also had no airport info attached - we didn't know which airport they would fly into! (we have 3 large airports near us) we contacted majestic berners and told them to not over-night the puppies and that we were very upset with how this is playing out because it did not match what we were originally told. we said we could wait until they could get a better flight so the puppies weren't stressed out.

     somehow, the issue was resolved (after we were told to ""calm down"" - very unprofessional if you ask me). we were told the puppies were on their way and the shipping agency would send a notification when they land so we could go pick them up at the airport today. no notification ever came.... 
in fact, our tracking number still says ""pending,"" as if they haven't gotten on the plane 12 hours after getting the first email saying the puppies were at the airport. our latest emails inquiring about what happened are not being answered.

we have no puppies and we are out $1500.00

the ""breeder"" conveniently has a speech impediment so they can't talk on the phone, and no one answered the phone when we called (however, according to the website the wife/business partner does not have a speech impediment so you would think she could talk to us). everything was done thru emails. no email was ever signed by name, and no name is mentioned on the website. the only name we got was alan h. on the contract and payment information. and, the tax records for the address we were given do not list an alan h. at that address. 

part of it was poor insight on our end. the website has no information on the lineage of the puppies - no bio on the breeding pairs. a good, professional breeder should have public information about the parent dogs. 

also, the instagram page from their website is a joke! no new posts since june 2019?! all posts say the same thing too! these people are greedy, emotionally manipulative scammers! do not buy puppies from them!

my mom is very upset about this. she has been depressed since the family dogs started declining and it got worse after they died. this is the most excited i've seen her in several months. she couldn't sleep all last night in anticipation for getting the puppies today. she spent all day today getting ready for the puppies. now, she has been crying for the last 3 hours over this. 
also, if anyone read through all this, is there any legal action we can take?

*to clarify, this is majestic berners with a dash in between those words. there is a majestic berners website with no dash that looks like a fantastic place. 

tl;dr - bought 2 puppies for $1500.00 from this ""breeder"" but we did not get any puppies"

"cannabisbuds.uk and the uk clearnet cannabis scam industry there is a whole page full of these sites on google:

background: cannabis is illegal in the uk. these clear-net scam sites will take the money and not send any goods.

let's look at the top ranking site cannabisbuds\[.\]uk specifically.

they make use of a chat widget from tidio, and a recent sales widget. i contacted tidio a couple of weeks ago and it looks like instead of removing them, they upsold them onto a paid service... i don't know - i will contact them again.

a sample of reviews on trustpilot shows what customers can expect:

unfortunately the site is behind cf but if anyone has any ideas to help let me know."
"can someone tell me if this is a kind of scam? so i've been looking for work and got a work (via upwork, if that's relevant) from home job that requires me to edit articles, and the company said they would provide me the stuff needed for work (laptop, software, printer, and time tracker). they then said they would reimburse the expenses. so here's where it gets weird: 

1. there has been only one contact, and he refuses to give me any other contact;
2. there is only one vendor, who has multiple accounts, which includes a zelle account that uses a different name other than his own (although zelle seems to know and reminded me);
3. the company emails (??!) me checks, and wants me to paypal/zelle it to the vendor (which is a hassle because of all the fraud protection that is hopefully false alert);
4. they gave three separate checks from three different banks;
5. the amount for work hardware/software is totaling up to $3000, i mean, really?

then again, the checks are accepted (at least for now) so i'm not sure if they're a scammer what they are after; could the checks be rejected after a few days? i've emailed the company from its website to check if it is legit but got no reply, and the guys been contacting me for more than a week now so even if it's for $3000 that would seem like an insult for a scammer. or perhaps there weren't so many works from home till corona so they don't really know what they are doing?

any thoughts? please help!"
"sugar daddy scam?? my friend recently got a new sugar daddy- it was a bit of her fault for not looking at the profile and considering if he was real- anyways he offered her $500 a week for you know what daily and things seemed fine. though he had her get a vanilla pre-paid card that was rechargeable as he apparently had a wife and if she saw the transactions or whatever and found out she would divorce him. 

she got the pre-paid but it wasn’t the rechargeable kind~ but besides  that she put $20 on the card and then got a transaction notice that a thing called “debdeb digital llc” took that $20 out. it’s apparently based in wyoming. we’re a little sketched out and thought it may be a scam- looked up debdeb digital and we couldn’t find anything. i know reddit’s always handy- help!"

"i just got scammed by best buy i just received an order i made with best buy.... in an amazon box. 

i was sitting here looking at the box and i realized that i had order 3 pairs of wireless headphones for my kids on best buy (canadian tech retailer big box store) and it arrived in an amazon box. so i quickly looked up the headphones on amazon and they sell for 28.99 with free shipping over $35.

after shipping and tax, the best buy headphones were 62.50 each. i over payed for the exact same headphones by $100.

if best buy has “market place” in the search they are just skimming amazon products and selling them as their own. 

i wonder if i complain to best buy if they refund me the difference.

be sure to double check best buy vs amazon."

"my mother was victim of a romance scam... greetings all! longtime lurker, just signed up to ask for advice...

my mother (retired, in her 70's) fell prey to the classic romance scam. started on a dating site, someone reached out to her to say his friend would be perfect for her, here's his email. they started communicating, it ramped up quickly, then he starts asking for money. she mentioned something about it at the beginning, i warned her about possible scams. finally, some things happen and i find out more, ask her about it, she comes clean. i'm now a week in to it trying to figure everything out. the good news is she realizes now that she was scammed and lost a fair bit of money. savings drained and a credit card run up. pretty similar to what i've read happening to too many people. 

in my research on this ""guy"" i found where the pictures were stolen from, discovered some of the fake online sites gift cards were used at, and figured out the website used to ""confirm"" his professional identity doesn't seem to be real (800 number is for a completely different company, address listed doesn't seem to be real, etc.). additionally, there were cashier's checks sent to a us address and  wire transfers to a us bank account (the scammer said it was his kid's house and account). using cadastral searches and talking to local police department, this secondary person is real, but likely unaware of the involvement as she is elderly. to be clear, a check was sent to a us address and it was somehow picked up and cashed. one was sent via ups (possibly redirected to a ups store???) and another was sent via usps to the address and picked up somehow. finally, there was a package sent overseas (i have the address, it was a laptop, i have the purchase info and could probably get serial numbers, etc.) and a number of those loadable visa/amex/mc cards. i've already filed a report with [ic3.gov](https://ic3.gov) and, as mentioned, spoke to the police in the us town. we've done what we can to lock down accounts, etc.

the kicker is this... the scammer doesn't know that i know and doesn't know my mother is aware of the scam. she is completely aware and super embarrassed and ashamed and getting mad. but she is still getting emails and the scammer answered a call (i have the number - but appears to be a voip). he's expecting another payout later this month when my mother's retirement check comes in. so, the question for the good people of reddit - is there something i can do to find out more about this/these scammer(s) given my mother hasn't been ghosted yet? again, i have a phone number, a us address, the us bank account information, and the address in the other country the computer was shipped to. i don't expect to ever recover the money but i'd love to prevent these people from victimizing someone else. thanks in advance!"

"weird update: solve my mystery - 14 phone calls in 12 hours from car-shipping companies who received a quote request with my phone number wtf is the scam i started getting these calls sunday. now wednesday, i have gotten over 100 unknown/unfamiliar phone calls - i counted yesterday and have given up. i've gotten around 50 texts too, all saying or implying they can quote me on shipping my nissan altima (i live in a city and don't have a car). 

from comments in my first post, it's possible someone typed their own number incorrectly in a quote request for shipping their car, website was fishy and sold user data to other companies. or could be a prank (i don't think this is likely). 

this afternoon, i got a text that sounded different from the dozens of other canned texts from a 954 area code. typos are theirs: 

""good afternoon, morgan (not my name), i'm ray adams, i'm sure you're getting overwhelmed with calls and texts but there are only 2 actual movers contacting you (we areon 1 of them). i sent you a guideline in an email that says""

that's the whole text. obviously i haven't replied. super weird thing to say when bombarded truly is the word for it - why would he even send this to me? why is this one text different and why does he imply he knows i'm getting 100+ calls? why would he say it's only two companies? do i respond or just ghost all of these forever?

additional weird thing: at 10:50 this morning, i got four pics of a super dirty, leaf-covered, very old mercedes ml350. 205 area code (same as mine). no context.

business  friends and all, if you receive a usb thumb drive in the mail, stop.   the fbi has issued a warning about a gift card/usb token attack that  everyone should be aware of.  an  individual receives an envelope or  package, allegedly from best buy, with a loyalty reward in the form of a  $50 gift card. in the envelope is a usb drive claiming to contain a  list of products eligible for purchase using  the gift card, however the fbi says that the usb contains malicious  files that will open your computer to attackers. the agency reports that  numerous businesses (retail, restaurant, hotel industry) have received  packages targeting employees in human resources, it, or executive  management departments.  we should expect this kind of attack to target  to consumers in the future. if you get a package like this, report it  online to the fbi's internet crime complaint center (ic3).

"credit card debt paid off by stranger scam? long  story short a stranger i met from a dating app gave me his business  checking account (bank of america), which he generously let me pay off  my credit card debts.

my balance  on both cards have updated and say 0. but for one of them my available  credit hasnt updated yet. i was wondering if it is possible for him to  reverse the payments made to my creditors and leave me at square one?  since he paid off my cards im being asked to purchase gift cards for him  that he'll pay me for after but the voice inside me screams 'scam'.

basically  my main worry is that i get him the gift cards and then he reverses the  payments on my credit cards somehow and then i'd be out 500$

how do i know if i've been scammed early on? i bought ringfit adventure from a guy on here. paid through cash app so i could get my money back if something happened. he originally wanted me to pay through paypal friends and family which if he was telling the truth i can understand why. he said he doesn't technically have a business paypal cuz he only sells things occasionally but there's no protection there if you are scammed when paying that way so that's when i chose cash app. they supposedly take ten days to investigate your claim and you get a refund. so i should be safe there but i paid the guy $100 and i don't want to wind up with any extra stress. he gave me a link to his imgur post of the game. it's supposedly coming with everything. but originally he wanted $140 plus shipping. i convinced him to lower the price and instead technically paid $85 for the game and $15 for shipping if he goes priority mail. that's a large price drop. he's supposedly mailing it out today. but i have yet to hear from him or receive a tracking number like i requested. also what makes it a bit questionable is apparently he was paying people cash for their gift cards and one of the people said he scammed them when i looked into it. reached out to the guy and everything. idk i'm just worried im gonna have a cluster fuck of a situation on my hands cuz i wasn't pacient enough.

"angry father scam? i (27m) matched with a girl on the dating app hinge the other day and we talked for a bit on there, then she asked if i wanted to text instead. we exchanged numbers and texted back and forth for a day, nothing seemed too out of the ordinary and we just talked about normal things. the next we texted again and things started getting sexual, she sent me a nude photo and asked for one in return. i (being a dumbass in quarantine) obliged. i didn't hear anything back for several hours, then received a series of texts from a man claiming to be her father, saying she was actually 16 (her profile said 20) and that he needed to speak to me. i freaked out and answered, and he angrily said he saw all these texts and would be going to the police if we couldn't work this out. i explained that i thought she was 20 but he didn't seem to care, and eventually he hung up. i checked back on hinge but her profile was gone.

today i received a call from an ""officer stevens"" saying he had questions for me about a complaint filed against me, then he texted me a picture of a realistic-looking warrant for my arrest. i haven't responded.

"should i be worried? this is the first time happening to me so i may have been a little naive about some things, but thankfully i detected the deception in the end.

so, i met this russian lady apparently called katrin on a website called lovepedia. she started writing to me because she was interested in a honest italian guy (which is a detail i included in my profile).

i immediately explained i did not want a long-distance relationship, but still i said why not and started writing her some ""letters"", as she called them.

some innocent chit chatting about our person lives, and she sending photos every time. i was never totally convinced because she didn't seem to understand. 

things got weirder once she apparently was only focusing on the letters and wanting to meet me. she was this beautiful russian lady, but i was still on the edge about the whole long-distance thing.

yesterday, she apparently went to the agency to ask a ticket to italy. she was gasped by the price, and today she asked a ""help"" for money. i stressed out the coronavirus situation, and she asked again for ""help"", for meeting. i called out the scam and blocked her.

now what's worrying me is that this scammer has some generic photo (no nudes, even remotely, not my nature), my name, my cellphone number, my email and some details on my personal life, which i don't really care for should she release them on the web.

now for the question. should i still be worried for something?"
"so i accidentally deposited what i think is a scam check. what do i do? so long story short, i accepted a work-from-home job and they want to send me equipment. they sent me a check that i am supposed to use for the equipment costs. and stupid me deposited the check into my bank account without a second thought...

but i'm worried that if i tell my supposed ""supervisor"" that i don't want to proceed with the job, they'll tell me to refund them the check they sent me. if this was a legit job, i wouldn't mind doing that. but if this is scam (which i'm 90% sure), i would just be sending them free money out of my own pocket? 

how do i deal with this situation? the money is already in my account so how am i supposed to refund this amount to them? it'll likely bounce after a few business days, but what if they threaten to sue me? scammers threatening to sue me wouldn't pose any threat, but then again there's a chance that the job is actually legitimate and then that'd be a problem. is there any way for someone to get back their check money as long as both parties agree (without having me send my own money to them)?"

"am i being scammed ok so i met a woman last night on a dating app who offered to be my sugar momma. i won't go into detail of what my job in that case is. the part that worries me however is the payment. she uses cash app and said she will pay me $300. if she had paid up front right away than of course i wouldn't be worried. but instead she gave me some guy cashid and said he's her accountant. she wants me to send $100 to him so he can verify i won't hack her than hell add me to her ""payroll"" and return the hundred i send. so yea imedeatlly red flags so i start to push against it so see how far she will go. i say i don't feel safe sending $100 dollars i don't know you very well. basically i make a whole sob story about how i barely get to work so my paycheck is only 150, i argue that that's to much money for me to risk can i verify with a lower amount. after some back and forth she agreed that it could be done with just $10 and once i'm ""varified"" i'd get my payment. part of me is still really skeptical but if she was a scammer would she really go through all that trouble than just settle for $10 bucks? would it be a risk if i sent the $10 bucks in? i'm not to worried about losing the money but is there anything else she could do or take advantage of me if i send it? i gave her the excuse that i still had to set up the cash app account and i had work today to give myself enough time to see if i really wanted to presue this further or if it's to risky. thanks"

"scammed by a mixer partner (fake giveaway) hi guys. 

earlier this year, a mixer partner streamer hosted a giveaway on [playr.gg](https://playr.gg) in the name of his team, and i was drawn as a winner on jan 2nd. i ""won"" a xbox one x bundle (with a headset, pubg and a gift code).

a few days after winning, i sent them a message to the team thanking them for the opportunity.

as i live in brazil, that has really strict rules about imported products (and taxes upon it), i had to consistently track the code so i could pay the tax and receive the product. so, two weeks later, i politely and humbly sent then another messaged asking if there was any kind of estimated shipping date. 

this is the messages i sent them:  
[https://i.imgur.com/zbun3iw.png](https://i.imgur.com/zbun3iw.png)

as you can see in the bottom of the image, i was blocked.

after seeing i was blocked (jan 21st), i immediately thought i was scammed, so i tweeted about it, and sent a message to the leader of the team. 

this was his response:  
[https://i.imgur.com/absz1td.png](https://i.imgur.com/absz1td.png)

in his response, it was implied that he still would send me the prize. of course, there was no reason not to, right? but he didn't. 

even though playrgg states that prizes can take up to 30 days (and not 60 as he said) to be sent, i waited for 60 days, and no prize or communication from him or the team whatsoever. 

so, i contacted playrgg through discord and the moderator sarah tried to help me, talking to him (the leader of the team). 

this was her response:  
[https://i.imgur.com/6iypqw1.png](https://i.imgur.com/6iypqw1.png)

so, i waited for 5 days, and there was absolutely no message from him. 

i contacted him, and he just ignored me, until the day that i really lost my temper and sent a message telling he was a scammer. 

he called me a disturbed person, and it turned into a really heated discussion from both parts, with a lot of name calling. 

he kept saying that he already sent the prize and that i was trying to scam him to get another prize, yet he couldn't provide a receipt or a tracking code. 

during the discussion, he said that he sent it using the ""royal mail"" service, and sent a link to get more details.

[https://i.imgur.com/qzu98wu.png](https://i.imgur.com/qzu98wu.png)

the curious thing is the link stated that the packages was limited to 2kg. xbox one x alone weights 3.8kg.

[https://i.imgur.com/8feawfd.png](https://i.imgur.com/8feawfd.png)

so, this is clearly a lie, and he just never intended to send the prize in the first place, he just wanted free followers and used the playrgg service for it.

later that night, i was really angry and reach him out on his stream, to alert his followers of the kind of guy he is. this is the message i sent on multiple accounts: ""hi! you guys that are participating in \[hidden name\]'s giveaway, don't get your hopes up. i won a giveaway he held in the name of \[team's name\] team earlier this year, and he just didn't sent the prize. he claims that he sent it, yet can't provide a receipt or tracking code. it was just a scam! if you don't condone with this atitude you should stop watching this guy.""

he banned me (of course why wouldn't he - but the look on his face looking the chat was really precious), and he got support from all the mixer's moderators who was currently there on reporting my account. he called me all kind of names live, like psychopath, disturbed child, a scammer, and so on... 

even worse, he said that i was trying to extort money from him telling that i want ""money sent to my paypal account"", mainly because of one sentence i said earlier on discord: ""if you don't want to all the trouble of having to buy a xbox and shipping it, you can deposite the value from the bundle on my paypal account. i won the giveaway, i deserve my prize.""

he convinced all the people in the stream to report me, so my mixer account was banned.

after that, i sent official and formal reports to mixer guardians (had just a generic response, i was really disappointed that they are still partnered with a scammer), to xbox ambassadors (they are investigating), and of course to action fraud (and the report was escalated to the national fraud intelligence bureau - nfib).

i tweeted the whole story and tagged all the members of the team that held the giveaway, and they all just blocked me. i mean, it's so weird that no one has even a little humanity and empathy to investigate this further to know who is the scammer of this story, isn't it?

if you really think about it ""what if the streamer is right and this random guy is trying to scam him?"" well, then why can't i see a receipt? but he doesn't have one, because he did not send me the prize i won. even if he ""lost"" it or doesn't want to show it, the service he told he used is incompatible with the weight of the package. it is clearly a lie. 

of course i am being a little heated and crazy about this. it just was going to be my first ever console, and i was so happily and excitedly waiting for it to arrive since jan 2nd. and to see he is backed by mixer and its community make it even worse.

what do you guys think about this?"

i was like oh sweet cuz she literally messaged me seconds after i posted my ad. i get in contact with her dad and this is where it turns sketch. he tells me his financier can't issue payments less than $3000 so he said he will send me last month's rent, and to send the remaining amount back to his financier. he said for this service alone, he will pay me $300. now i am confused because this seems to good to be true. all i have to do is withdraw my money, then send the remaining amount back to some person in the us?

"someone used my email to sign up for a scam site hey all,

this morning i received an [email](https://imgur.com/s3z16bx) from playjoltz, which upon looking it up it appears to be scam service based on streaming.

because the charge is $0 for a ""free trial"" there is nothing in my transactions.  but i'm keeping my eye out for anything strange.

i've searched my email in [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) and only found the same things from years ago which i've fixed. i have also checked the security logins on my email account and there's a couple of suspicious attempts from russia, south korea, and argentina within moments of each other but they were unsuccessful but just to be safe i also changed my password. 

i'm just wondering if there's anything else i can do? i've been trying to wean everything over to a new email address but i just haven't gotten around to it. is it possible that the email is just a trap to make me feel paranoid and contact their services, so i should just ignore it?

is it possible to check whether the check slip i deposited into my bank account is real or not by contacting my bank? would they know? please help!"
"it finally happened. i got scammed. bank transfers aren't as safe as i once thought. i thought my 'scam radar' was pretty good but it turns out it's broken. i sold a $200 clothing gift voucher code (that i received as a promotional gift) on gumtree for $150. i need the money for my car rego and repairs more than i need new clothes. 

the guy didn't seem shifty and did a bank transfer + sent a photo of the payment being successful and it clearly being sent to my bank account number. i thought ""surely that's safe. it says it's complete."" so i sent the code to him. payments can take several days to so i didn't want him thinking that i was scamming him. ha! the irony.

7 working days later and i still haven't received the payment. contacted my bank and they said i've been scammed. 

i feel like such an idiot. i haven't stopped stress crying because i can just afford my car rego but will have to forego car repairs for probably several months as i'm unemployed currently. 

i don't get how the banks can't do more for scam victims. i have text message proof plus photographic evidence that they ""paid"" me but haven't received the funds. why can't banks forcefully take the money from his account? 

i'll be reporting the scam to my local police but still, even their website says the chances of getting money back is slim. it's virtually hopeless. 

why isn't there a 100% secure way to receive money? or better yet, why can't bank transfers be instantaneous as to stop this kind of scam? 

sorry for the rant, i'm just so upset and angry at myself right now. 

also, please don't be stupid like me and fall for bank transfer scams."

hello!

&amp;#x200b;

as you may have noticed, i sent you an email from your account.

this means that i have full access to your operating system.

&amp;#x200b;

i've been watching you for a few months now.

the fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.

&amp;#x200b;

if you are not familiar with this, i will explain.

trojan virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.

this means that i can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.

&amp;#x200b;

i also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

&amp;#x200b;

why your antivirus did not detect malware?

answer: my malware uses the driver, i update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.

&amp;#x200b;

i made a video showing how you masturbate in the left half of the screen,and in the right half you see the video that you watched.

with one click of the mouse, i can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks.

i can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.

&amp;#x200b;

if you want to prevent this,

transfer the amount of $950(usd) to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to google: 'buy bitcoin').

&amp;#x200b;

my bitcoin address (btc wallet) is: 1jpc1ytkvl21q4bf9mbapundcnmx4q65ua

&amp;#x200b;

after receiving the payment, i will delete the video and you will never hear me again.

i give you 48 hours to pay.

i have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.

&amp;#x200b;

filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address.

i do not make any mistakes.

&amp;#x200b;

if i find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.

&amp;#x200b;

best regards!"

"ebay user with 60+ positive feedback on his one year old account wants to deal outside of ebay- he's in china, but wants it shipped to a place in my city- could this be a scam? first off, i have done several deals over the past few years with people in asia who asked me to ship to a freight forwarding service for whatever reason, and thus far all the transactions have gone smoothly, without any hiccups. 

but i would just like to get your opinion on the current situation... 

i have a high-end bag (louis vuitton) listed on ebay that i was contacted about today by a guy in china who wants to buy it. he said he wanted to deal outside of ebay due to some 10% tax, and also made a bit of a lowball offer. i hit him up on his e-mail (which was some weird e-mail that was just a long number @ qq.com which i found is a common server there... no worries there), and we continued to negotiate a bit before settling on a price. then he says he needs until tomorrow to connect his cc to pp and that i can go ahead and send him a money request- he'd be paying in the morning his time. 

the thing is, the address he gave me isn't in china, but it happens to be a 20 min drive from me. i offered to drop it off in person at no charge, but he said it's not possible as it's a company. didn't really make sense- why wouldn't a company be able to accept something from me? anyways, no biggie, i charge him for what i expect shipping will cost- around $30. 

i even asked him how i know for sure it's not a scam and he got quite offended and sent me screen caps of various deals he's done where he bought stuff from the uk, germany, australia, usa, etc. as well as his stockx profile, but half the writing is in chinese which i don't understand. also, he claims his last name is ""fzdvbf"" (yes, all caps like that), which i'm 1000% certain is not a real name. i don't know if the place is some shipping forwarder and that's some kind of reference code for them, but he insisted that's his last name. 

the interaction seemed genuine insofar as his bargaining, questioning the authenticity, and getting offended when i raised concern over it potentially being a scam... but i dunno, i guess i just get a bit of a scammy vibe for some reason- and i know you should trust your gut, but i've been proven wrong in similar situations in the past. it's just that louis vuitton (or any brand name) stuff really seems to bring the scammers out in masses- the stuff i shipped to forwarders before was guitar-related. 

so am i safe to proceed? i understand there's ways people can scam you even after money has landed in your paypal, so that's what i'm most worried about now:

[https://multichannelmerchant.com/blog/5-paypal-chargeback-scams-prevent/](https://multichannelmerchant.com/blog/5-paypal-chargeback-scams-prevent/)

i told him that due to the value of the item, i'll have to make it signature required, which might help me some should he try to pull anything.

"fell for a holiday rental scam in spain, lost €2715 so here’s how the scam went down.

i found a listing in marbella on airbnb that was advertising good rates and sent them a message.

the person sent me their number and asked to talk via whatsapp, which i did.

they then told me it would be better for them to make the booking through tripadvisor and sent me a link to book the property through them, which after looking into it they had a bunch of good reviews spanning 7 years, after looking into travadvisors booking guarantee policies i decided it was safe to book.

so i confirmed the booking and received an email apparently from traveladvisor linking me to a booking page and ways to pay.

the option available was direct bank transfer so i sent them the first month plus a €700 guarantee, total of €2715 which i transferred via instant payment.

completely my own stupid fault but it was all a giant scam, i started to get suspicious today and talked to tripadvisor and they confirmed it was a fraudulent website and it’s nothing to do with them, they won’t offer any further assistance and told me to go to the police, as did my bank who said the money is gone due to sending it as an instant payment.

just wanted to bring this to light and hopefully warn others that might fall into the same trap.

i’m going to share the info of the scam so hopefully anyone else dealing with this person might see this post first.

name of the scammer / the bank account owner;

bank acc name: daniel prieto sanchez / scammer: mauricio aldino
address of property: calle alcala 15d, marbella, spain
scammer email: mauriciisjaj1@outlook.es
ph: 642 144 510
scam website: tripadvisor.reservation-esp.com / reservation-esp.com / reservation-sp.com

all this is disconnected now, phone not working etc so i’m not sure how much help it would be but you never know.

tripadvisor and airbnb have both told me it’s nothing to do with them and they won’t be any further help so i’ve realised the €2715 i paid them is gone and lost, my bank also says because it was an instant transfer the money is long gone and there’s nothing they can do.

they have recommended i let the police sort it out so i’ll be going to visit them in the morning but i realise they’re not going to recover the cash and probably won’t even look into it so it looks like a total loss."
"scammer pretended to be relative and mom went with it, even when she had suspicions after every response. yesterday my mom received a whatsapp message from an unknown number. they texted her *hii mom! it's me! i've washed my phone in the washingmachine by accident [emoji], i'm so dumb [emoji] ! i use an old phone now[emoji]!* my mom answered asking who it was and the response was to take one guess. she answered with the first letter of my sis' name and was confirmed by the scammer. he then proceeds to tell her money was low and bills needed to be paid. my mom doesn't have any money in the bank and asks to pay the bills from my sis' bank account, since mom has access due to reasons. the scammer insist on sending the money to a friend and have that friend pay the bills. my mom asks what friend, since she knows every single friend of sis', but she doesn't get a name and just has to trust it. she gets one of those transfer money links from a bank and opens it , leading to her bank app. she notices a name she doesn't recognize and asks for explanation. the scammers says it's the bank account of a friend of a friend and that all is discussed with said friends, so no worries. she sends the money and the scammer asks for more. mom says both accounts are empty and the scammer asks if there's any money left somewhere else. there isn't and the conversation is ended.

today my sister sends a message in the group app, telling there's around 100$ dollar transferred from her account to an unknown account an it wasn't her, so she thinks she is scammer somehow. mom confesses she felt for the scam and transferred the money. she broken-down crying uncontrollably and is a mess now because of the guilt. she sends us the conversation she had with the supposed to be my sis scammer and we conclude that there are so many red flags . my mom did notice them during the conversation, even asked about it, but somehow she thought it was all legit.

i can't imagine why mom would go along with it  because of so many obvious red flags. my sis doesn't ask mom for money, because mom has no income. besides, without phone she could also reach her account via pc or via her partner. if money is tight for both sis and her partner, they would always ask dad for a loan not mom. 
my sis only puts emoji at the end of her text, not in the middle of sentences. her text are always long and full of too many details which include her partner's finances when discussing koney. the scammer used short texts and didn't given any detail nor mentioned a partner.


police will make a report tomorrow, bank cards are blocked and passwords are changed. 

i'm scared they got information and data besides the money. i'm scared they will continue to reach out to mom, scammers always have succes despite her having suspicions. i'm scared mom will use my name next time and have this repeated all over, with bigger losses."

"swedish auction site hired me to transfer their buyer's money scam? (someone smack me and tell me i'm a dumbass) site - [auktion](http://www.auktion.se/p/wp.e) a swedish auction site.

info they sent me- [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14biwbabsujancupw8mb-f0zkxdifjp_7/view)

 hi, i was approached via job site by a swedish auction site called auktion se to be an escrow agent. an escrow agent is a third party that holds large amounts of money during an item's sale until the item arrives where it's supposed to go.

here is essentially what my new supervisor told me. their auction site offers the buyer and the seller the option to use any form of money sending platform they would like. paypal, bitcoin, western union, moneygram, you name it. it's then my job to take that potentially large sum of money to a bank in my city and transfer it into the form of money chosen by the seller. buyer sends money one way, i transfer it so i can send it to the seller once the item arrives.

it's all work-from-home so i have only been in contact with my supervisors via phone and email. taking sums of money from bank to bank every day seems fishy, even though legally i can't see any issues.

has anyone heard of anything like this before? is this the most elaborate scam ever?  

\*\*okay guys, this is 99.9999 a scam. the woman who contacted me is using an email ""@aukttion"" with two t's. my fiance pointed out that the website might be legit as well as the woman's instagram page, however, the supervisor who contacted me is the one running the scam.

"am i working for a home security scam? i picked up a remote work from home job to help pay the bills while i get through school. 

supposedly this company is partnered with adt,  brinks,  and core. what’s fishy to me, is it’s a recorded script, offering $850 in free equipment, and no activation fees. the script also offers lower prices from “competitors” if they are already have a system from one of the 3. not to mention, everyone is “pre approved” 

i’m feeling very skeptical about this, but i don’t know if this is normal for adt marketing. the company itself is very small, and also extremely, extremely unprofessional. i can’t imagine an actual successful company partnered with adt would be very small, unprofessional, and have a “ceo” who sits on skype and trash talks his employees and makes condescending comments to everyone frequently. we were also told we are being paid hourly, on the first day a couple people quit, he lost his temper, and threatened us that if we don’t stay for the entire day, we won’t get paid...i mean is that even legal?

"job posting social security number scam? am i screwed? please help me.  hi everyone,

so i applied to a job posting and i had a phone interview then they sent me an application requesting my driver's license, social security, work history, references, etc.

however, after i sent my application, i looked up the place.

it's a small private equity firm according to the interview guy so there's no website for it.

also, the description of the job on the hiring post was the same word for word description used for multiple other hiring posts.

he wanted to do a video skype interview, but changed it and said let's do it over the phone.

i looked up the guy, he's on linkedin but no profile picture, with a lot of other connections and the cfo of the private equity firm (he has a picture).

"express cv like many people i have found myself out of work as my industry was shut down due to covid-19.

i needed to write a cv when i signed up for job seekers allowance so i used a cv template at the webpage expresscv.com as it seemed that it was quick, simple and it was only 90p. or so i thought.

i was charged 90p but then i there was an additional charge of £29.90. i did not agree to, nor was i aware of this charge. i continually phoned my bank but never got through due to them having a skeleton team at this time.

after contacting express cv five times through their online form (their email address is hidden within the site) they got in contact over a week later with a supposed form to fill out. the form wasn’t attached. i emailed them to tell them.

a couple of days later they responded with a link- which takes you to a page where you can’t fill out the fields.

they also gave the option of handwriting a form. i did this. they responded to say i had missed the seven day cancellation period- even though they delayed to respond at their end.

after waiting on hold for close to four hours- i finally got through to the fraud department at my bank to report them.

i wanted to put this out there as i know a lot of people are in the same boat as me and will want to write a cv. there are hundreds of people on trust pilot who have said they have also been scammed by express cv. so i am not alone. all of them have had the same experience as me- some of them have had multiple payments taken out.

 they are taking advantage of people needing to write cv’s and not being able to contact their banks to report the money they are stealing. the £29.90 is a recurring payment and there is no where to cancel the payment on their site.

please don’t use https://expresscv.com they are scam artists."

hello dear,

thanks for the interested  in regards to our golden retriever puppies,our family takes great care to make sure all
our puppies are very socialized and friendly with other pets.they come
with all up to date shots and also seen by our vet before going to their

environment. we have two puppies available and their names are teddy and
daisy .

daisy
she is home and potty trained.
she does not bark a lot.
she is friendly with kids and other pets.
she get angry when you shout at her.

teddy
he is home and potty trained
he barks more than daisy  but not to much. he is also a friend to kids and other pets. he barks when he sees strangers.

i have some few questions

are you familiar with  golden retriever  puppies? where are you located?
do you have a vet doctor? how old are you? what is your occupation?
are you interested in teddy the male or daisy the female or both?
how soon do you want the puppy?

my reason for setting these babies for adoption is being that i just lost my only sister who was the only one who could take good care of these babies and i've just relocated to a new location and my duty here is tight up that we even regret bringing the puppies over with

"i'm a wreck, please help i was hacked a while back, ( as in someone/something logged into all my accounts and started using them and changing passwords and all that good stuff ).

 since i've been terrified that there is someone trying to get into all my accounts and haven't been even able to sleep properly. 

i've taken all the steps to get them back and got all of them back, but i'm still petrified that someone or something ( i've been told it's probably a bot by someone, if someone could tell me if it most likely was that would be great )  is trying to invade my world.

has anyone else felt like this? if you have what did you do to combat it?"

is this a rotating store scam? just using the virus to get people who are looking for products?

"my mom got scammed out of $20,000 my mom was talking to this guy she found online. she told me she’s known him back in 2007 and they were dating but things didn’t work out and she couldn’t marry him. she said she found him again and they’ve been talking for 4 months. how ever they’ve never met irl and never facetimed. 

he claims to be a doctor and surgeon... and he says he’s rich... he said he has a young  daughter who is in boarding school in the uk. he  also said he is currently in syria with the “international medical corp”. he said he had a contract with them for 2 years and the contact was just ending on march 25th. he said he was going to come back to the us and buy a house for them in california. 

when my mom told me the news about everything i was very doubtful and suspicious, i warned her about everything and i did not believe it at all. my mom reassured me not to worry and she trusts him and how they’ve known each other since 2007... 

he had asked my mom for a lot of money with the excuse that it was for the house and because he is in syria he can’t buy anything... or the currency makes it difficult... he also claimed to have a finance manager in the uk who my mom got in contact with. the finance manager asked for my mom’s information to make more purchases for the guy my mom is talking to. my mom gave him all her personal information, bank information... my mom also bought prepaid credit cards for him. i was forbidding my mom to give him anything but she didn’t listen to me. my mom gave the finance manager this one code to “confirm a purchase” but there was so many more purchases after that. but the boyfriend kept saying he will wire her money and he’s just borrowing it and he’ll wire her money... when my mom asked the finance manager about that he said he never got any authorization about wiring money. 

my mom had changed all the bank passwords and closed her card. when my mom asked her “boyfriend” about what he was doing, he said it was all the bank manager and he had become bad all of a sudden (he’s been working for him for 2 years) and for her to change all her 
information and never give it to anyone. but then when she asked the finance manager about it he said he is just a middle man and he thinks the boyfriend is suspicious. he said if she tells him the truth and if he is taking her money then he will report him because he found a lot of suspicious activity in the “boyfriend’s” account. 

the “boyfriend” told my mom not to talk to him again and that he is bad. he told us he will try to figure something out and wire some money in her account. 

like earlier he wanted us to fly to california but my mom wanted to drive instead. so we did drive from the east coast all the way to arizona. we are in arizona right now because we have no where to go in california and the corona is really bad there. he said he will come to the us as soon as possible and for us to just wait in a hotel in arizona and everything will be ok... 

it’s been a week+ of living in this hotel and he pretty much just ghosted us. 
in total we are 20k in debt from credit cards and real money stolen. they are also using my mom’s identity to make more credit cards under her name. 

we think either 1) the boyfriend lied to both the finance manager and us telling him something like “oh this is my girlfriend’s account, you can take money from it whenever i tell you to... she still has more money. it’s ok.” or 2) they’re both just working together to scam us dead. 

she did alert the police the first time he asked for money and she thought it was suspicious. but the police said they can’t do anything since she gave him the information and he isn’t in state or in country... but now it’s a lot more money and more serious.

is there anything we can do? i mean technically my mom gave them the information her self... but she didn’t authorize all the purchases right? she gave one code that she knew she was giving and all the other purchases she didn’t really authorize. they’re also using her identity to make credit cards which is identity theft? please give me some advice and help."

"someone tried to create a spotify account with my email address, any advice on what to do? i'm not sure if this is the place to ask but it seemed like a good place to get someone's 2 cents worth on the matter. recently i got a legit looking email from spotify asking to confirm my account, to finish creating it. problem is i've never touched spotify before in my life, so it wasn't me. i never clicked on the email. it came from their legit email address. with that, it was probably a mistake and i thought ignoring it would allow it to be solved on it's own. but then i got another email saying they reset the password because there was detected suspicious activity and that the password needs to be changed. the weird thing is i never clicked the email to confirm the account, is that what they're finding 'suspicious'? why would they email me saying to reset the password if the email address was never confirmed? that seems odd to me. 

should i just keep ignoring the emails and move on? i've considered blocking the email address but i'm not sure what good it'd do. there's sites i've used which somehow knew their emails were going to the spam folder/bouncing and will deactivate your account if it keeps happening, i told them i marked them as spam because i was getting too many emails from them. but i don't know if something like spotify will do that if their email address gets blocked. it'd be nice if it did cause that might let them know it's the wrong email address. but i doubt that anyone here would know if blocking them would be enough to solve the issue, chances are all it'd do is cause me to not see the emails come through anymore. 

**tl;dr** what the title says and i didn't even open the email to ""confirm the account"" but then i got another one saying they reset the password because of suspicious activity, i've never had a spotify account, and probably never will especially after this. so i'm wondering if blocking the email address would be enough to ""fix"" the issue or not."

"job scam? hi all. first time posting on reddit, but i feel i need some insight as to whether or not this thing is a scam.

&amp;#x200b;

i've recently started working with a company called gedcommunity, an organization designed (at least from what i've been told) to help exchange students come to canada to learn. they are currently based in montreal, and are planning to open another office in my area in the summer. i had applied to this company on indeed, and within a week i had received a job offer for an administrative assistant position. they claimed to pay $25 an hour for the first 30 days, then $30 an hour after that. given the current covid crisis, this sounded amazing. i could work from home, and make good money doing it.

&amp;#x200b;

i accepted the job, as was given my first project. i was to create a powerpoint presentation detailing some interesting things in my area in order to appeal to exchange students. got it done no problem, and was told they really liked it. great. they then gave me my second project, researching \~30 hotels and hostels in the area so students would have a place to stay. no problem, easy enough. while working on that, i receive a phone call from the person i assume is my supervisor.

&amp;#x200b;

long story short, essentially i was told that there is currently european exchange students in halifax (several provinces away from me) that are unable to return to their home countries due to covid, and as such need to stay at their hotel for a longer period of time. i thought that sounded pretty rough, so i asked what i could do. she asked what my atm withdrawal limit was, and i told her it was around 3000. she said they would email transfer me some money in order to make a payment to the hotel these students were staying at, as apparently the hotel was having issue with online money transfers.

&amp;#x200b;

giving this more thought, it feels a lot like money laundering. i'm hoping you all could give me some more insight and opinions on this. here's an imgur link with some screenshots of messages i've been sent.

once i found a good offer, i reached out to the person and he told me he only accepts cash, so he gave me his number and i paid him 260 dollars through apple pay. i didn't know him. i just had his phone number. we starter talking and he said i didn't have anything to worry about. an hour later he stopped texting me. i didn't freak out, because he said i wouldn't have to worry about it as he would send over the tracking info later. it's sunday; i texted him and he did not answer. the messages say ""delivered, "" yet there is no answer from him. then i start thinking he might have scammed me. his profile on offerup is still there, so i reported him today, monday. 
i called both apple and my bank and they said there could do nothing of the sort. so, i still have his phone number, but he probably dumped it or something like that. 

what should i do? 

i know i won't get my money back, but what can i do?"

"solve my mystery - 14 phone calls in 12 hours from car-shipping companies who received a quote request with my phone number wtf is the scam please help me figure out why i am being bombarded with companies who want to ship my nonexistent nissan altima. 

yesterday at 6:00 pm exactly i started getting a slew of texts and calls from shipping companies saying they received my request for a quote on shipping my altima. 6 calls within 15 minutes. the calls slowed down after that but i got two or three later ones. i returned one of the first calls because i didn't know what was happening and the woman told me to just text back that i did not request a quote. i did that for the first 6 or so texts but then stopped because my bf said i shouldn't in case it was scammy. 

9:00 this morning on the dot the calls start rolling again. 7 calls from 9 am to 10:22 am. every single call and text is a different shipping company, always trying to ship my nissan altima. some texts address morgan, which is not my name.

some details:
- i just moved this weekend and hired a moving company, but don't think it's related - bf hired the company with his number. 
- i posted a few for sale ads on craigslist this week but didn't include my phone number in the post/ways to contact me.
- every call or text is a different company from all over the u.s.

what the fuck is going on? what kind of scam could this possibly be? who would benefit from using my phone number to contact every car shipping company in the continental u.s.?"

"beware: local computer fixing shops a month or so ago, my grandmother needed her computer updated from windows 7, she believed that she had been hacked, so she went to the local pc fixer guy.  according to my grandma, he explained that not only did she need a windows update, but there appeared to be a dangerous virus that had infected her computer and needed ""professional extermination"". he also told her a bunch of bullcrap about how he'll ""make her life easier by adding these widgets to your home screen"".

she came back the next day to pick up her laptop, and he told her that she has some ""new programs"" to help her out, and that he would be charging $600. yesterday i was at her home checking on her to see how she was doing and i needed to use her computer. i went up, and i was horrified. the webcam light was on. teamviewer was opened and these widgets the guy gave her had covered up the entire desktop page. i immediately opened control panel, and deleted all the applications i didn't recognize, and installed malware bytes. 

the malware bytes scan detected over 400 threats. which i wiped. i explained it all to my grandma, and she is much more aware now and is understanding. luckily, she said that she hasn't used to computer to enter a credit/debit card number or any personal info since november. we reported the shop, and i called the guy and screamed at him until he finally returned $550 via paypal. 

lesson: consult a few relatives/friends before going to a ""professional"". this guy basically charged my poor grandmother $600 to install windows 10 and some spyware. i could've done the same for free..."

if you used paypal to start the trial instead of a credit/debit card you can easily cancel through paypal. 


sign into paypal and locate settings 



locate the payments option (on mobile site its the third choice located directly above your paypal profile photo)

go to manage automatic payments and locate shaw academy. 
click cancel.

also, the website was apparently made really recently so that could raise some suspicions. it also seems that they dont have a contact number like a phone number they only seem to respond by emails.

so i requested to pay through paypal but the person said she got ripped off from a buyer before through paypal and now would only use google pay or venmo. i was very naive and trusting (i know i know, so stupid but i felt sad that people have to close their businesses during this time of crisis) and sent the money and she stopped responding to email/text. i kept requesting my money back and she declined/blocked me.

anyways, i want to call on the reddit community to help with flooding this scammer email with email asking for money back or random stuff (whatever you want) so that she would be busy scrolling through them and not have time to scam someone else. a personal revenge per say. email are: [craftconnectiondelaware@gmail.com](mailto:craftconnectiondelaware@gmail.com) or [alisamcleod54@gmail.com](mailto:alisamcleod54@gmail.com) . the number listed in the craiglist ad are three022133830 or three022120334. feel free to flood that with messages too.

"are they trying to scam me though cash app? so i’m trying to sell my canon camera sl1 on offerup and this person messaged me and seemed pretty real. usually i do get messages asking if it’s for sale and then if they could have my number. this person asked me questions about shipping and just normal human questions. then he asks for like price, etc. and then asks for my phone number. i get really cautious and guarded at this point and i ask him why he needs my number. so, obviously i don’t want to give him my number because anything can happen, so i go download a free texting app and get a free number to give to him. before i did that, i asked him why he needed it and that i was wary about giving it out because so many “people” have been messaging me for it. all he says is “ok good luck with that” and i’m really taken aback by that. i would think if they weren’t trying to scam me, they would try to assure me or something. so i just gave them the app number and they messaged me on it. they said they wanted to pay me through cash app, which i’m okay with because they would have to trust me to get the product, not the other way around. so they ask for my cashtag and email which i send, thinking that’s not too big a deal. they say that they are going to do the payment and they will let me know. so a few minutes later he texts and says “hello i am done with the payment now and i got an email from cashapp did you also get any email from cashapp because they informed me that they have also emailed you?” (i copy and paste the message). i go to check the email and then he texts again saying “yes, due to what i read it’s because your account isn’t business account so i think it has limit .... i also got the email from cashapp that your account is not a business account and i have to send you additional $150 for your account to be credited and fully upgraded to business account and once i do that your account will be fully credited immediately ok.” now i am so scared lol like i don’t know how to go about this because it seems like a scam. i looked at the address that sent me the email and it was cashs.squaree@gmail.com. i looked up cash apps actual email which is cash@square.com, so i text the person and say “the email i received wasn’t from actual cash app i don’t think. it was cashs.squaree@gmail.com.” they respond with “what do you mean ? this happening because of the newly policy of scams going on these days why you just aware. so after i send that to get your account settle as been instructed then you will send my 150 back to me.” someone please help and advise me on what to do next. i was really hoping this would work out, but i think it was too good to be true."

tldr:  

some moronic home-grown fake check scammers stole people's mail to find checks with bank routing/account numbers, and then used that information to print up fake checks, which they then used themselves to purchase goods from local stores.

they were not caught because of any of the above.  they were caught because they were staying in a hotel, and the hotel employees found a bag of blank checks outside their door, and they were suspected of smoking in their room so the employees went in to check it out and found more blank checks and a color printer (used to print up the fake checks)."

"cobra tate self-help packages. so yesterday i was scrolling through the web (twitter mainly) and i stumbled upon a man named andrew tate (aka, the millionaire with the longest twitter thread dissing on star wars). within a majority of those tweets, he had a link to his website where you can buy online courses that cover multiple subjects. these included how to get women, fitness, body language, mental toughness, etc.

after hearing this, i said to myself, ""that's cool, let's check it out."" little did i know how much these actually would cost...

(i converted the original currency from pounds to dollars)

how to pick up women - $413.50
fitness program - $241.72
body language - $366.87
iron mind - $671.17
the war room (which is a membership where you can network with millionaires and professionals) - $1,591.42

i can go on, but i want to get to why i'm here. from looking at this, i can just simply go get a book off of amazon, which would contain the same information on its subject. another thing i want to ask about is personal experience. have any of you ran into this or any similar self-help program and fell for it? if so, how was your experience?

thanks for reading this and have a great day!"

"i clicked on a phishing link from my phone. what do i do next? hi all. i got an email, text, and phone call from my bank about some debit charges. i had just gotten up and wasn't thinking straight. i clicked on the link from my phone to say that the charges were not valid and then verified my phone number and (i think) address when they called me.

turns out it was a phishing attempt and i am embarrassed to say that i fell for it. 

my credit is already frozen on all three bureaus and i have been using a two-authentication app for a while. the password is unique (use a password manager), but i've changed it anyway.

my question is what to do about my phone? do i need to do a factory reset on it? anything else i should be doing?

thank you!"

two days later i received a call from maryland +1 (667) 213 5229 . the guy told me that the job will be is to inspect packages and send them to one of their warehouses. to my naivety i didn't notice anything suspicious. he asked for my id which i sent to him. the same day in the evening he sent me an employment contract from an e-mail [hr@solve-easy.com](mailto:hr@solve-easy.com) . the company's name was solve easy llc with the website [solve-easy.com](https://solve-easy.com), located in maryland, baltimore, 100 international drive, 21202. then he told me my personal manager will follow-up tomorrow and that i had to pass a probationary period.

the next day my personal manager called me from +1 (667) 213 2553 . she sent me instructions on how to do my job and the link to the control panel  [https://mypanel.solve-easy.com/login](https://mypanel.solve-easy.com/login) with tasks via e-mail [trinitychua@solve-easy.com](mailto:trinitychua@solve-easy.com) and told me to take a tutorial and then get back to her. i completed my tutorial and she told me to wait for shipping supplies.

i didn't receive any shipping supplies but i received my first task on 1st of april, this year. they sent underwear to my name via ups. i resent this to 111 buck rd, huntington valley, pa, 19006 to a guy with russian name.

&amp;#x200b;

3 days later i received 3 other packages. i started to be suspicious because all the names on the packages were different. i asked my manager the reason but she said those names were generated randomly to ensure accurate inspection results. i didn't know why i believed it, probably because i was really hoping i was working for a real company. so i started to take photos of the packages and repack them in my home. my friend asked me what i was doing and i told him i am a receiver and i have to inspect packages then sent them to a warehouse.

i sent all those packages via fedex on 3rd of april around afternoon, yesterday, to 600 centerpoint blvd, qwintry ste 31-27618ue, new castle, de 19720 . 

after an hour i got a message from my friend with some youtube videos in it. i didn't want to believe what was in those videos but everything checked in. so i went to chicago police department but due to covid-19 they told me to file a claim through phone. i called the number, after a few transfers an operator gave me a number which i tried to call but noone responded there.

so started googling and found the number of uspis, i called it but they told me they only investigate packages sent through usps and that i needed to call fedex. i went to fedex location i sent packages with but they told me the packages were already gone. 

i filed complaints with  [https://www.ic3.gov/](https://www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx) and [ftc.gov](https://ftc.gov) as well as emailing fedex at [abuse@fedex.com](mailto:abuse@fedex.com) to hold the deliveries. 

in the end i called fedex customer care and told them everything i knew. they told me my only option was to return all the packages to the original sender on shipping labels. the original senders had different addresses. i confirmed, if those packages can't be returned to store, better they end up in someone else's hands than scammers. 

the original senders' addresses where all the fedex packages will be returned: 

510 ne 190th st, miami, fl 33179

4175 royal dr nw, kennesaw, ga 30144, ste 300

1001 technology way, libertyville, il 60048

&amp;#x200b;

i hope that police will seize those packages but usually they don't bother.

the lesson has been learned and i am still looking for a job."

"i fell for csgo gambling site scams. beware of friends sending fake sites. i was gambling at a gambling site and i won 200 coins (what is like 150 dollars) of course i was really happy and a friend of mine was aswell for me. after a few minutes, that friend asked me to check a site for him. i have known him for 2 years (online friend) so i thought yeah why not i can help him.

when he has sent me the website he asked me to log in and check if it would work. of course, i should have known it was a scam but i was so happy and the adrenaline was shocking in me. so stupid of me that i did log in... please don't make this mistake to log in on a website even if it is a (friend) ....  


then he tipped himself on my account with the 200 coins.

i mentioned this to the site owners and they didn't react in time so they were not able to send me back the coins.... if they would have reacted immediately i had my money but they reacted 10 minutes too late.

please don't get scammed by this kind of people.  
this happened on csgoempire btw."

"fell for a kik catfish, sent them pics/vids, scared of blackmail so i met someone on reddit and we moved to kik, we started talking and exchanged face pics. 2 weeks later we talk again and start exchanging explicit photos, and they send me the same exact face picture but it said from camera, so i knew they spoofed it and figured it was a catfish. at this point they had a short video and 2 pictures of me. they wanted a video with me talking but thankfully i didn't send one. i think they're benign because they have an 1100 day old account and didn't ask for personal information, but the chance of them blackmailing me is still there. they have no information but my face, and i nuked any accounts they saw. all my social media is now private or deleted and i tried my best to make it impossible to find me by name, phone number, or reverse searching any of the pictures i sent them. is there anything else i can do to protect myself? can they find me with just my face? am i paranoid for no reason? i'm genuinely freaking out. no pictures i sent had details of me or my location (unless kik sends metadata). thank you for reading."
"bellwether alliance = $1200 secret success law scam well everyone, i really went down the rabbit hole on this one. after being contacted by ""an ambassador"", i was curious enough to reply for more info, and set-up a call. the ambassador told me of a viceroy and regent council, and of members who are entrepreneurs small and large, including those in fortune 500 companies, and celebrities. the correspondence and person on call told me to be secretive and not talk about this opportunity with anyone not in the organization, and that i had to have been nominated by a current member to join. i couldn't find much information online, on reddit etc., on whether this was legit or not. i did find some llc formation paperwork etc, and website ownership papers leading to pensacola florida, all within the past 6 months-3 yrs. after listening to an hour long call presentation from the viceroy (using a free call-in conference call server) he made a final plea for membership, expressing that there are dues, like that of a rotary. after having the final email sent to me, after which an ""open cycle"" of 72 hours would begin; you must express your alignment with the core values to a given number (the viceroy said this would be the number of the ""regent council""), and then pay your dues to join, after which you are given a ""secret coin"" you can use to identify yourself to other members physically, or if online, use the term ""coin carrier"", in a discreet way. you are supposed to focus on learning the ""core values"" during this time; there are 52 of them; equalling a ""million dollar education"" based on secrets. secrets that are hundreds of years old, and potentially had been hidden from the masses, to prevent them from gaining wealth. this is not some do-gooder rothschild secret money cult, that will solve all your problems. this is daniel vega, of pensacola florida. pls see below link for his ""blu university"" that teaches all the same things. this can be found online for $1200, $500, or free if you are one of the ""100 scholarships"" he gave away in one of his videos, on youtube. they also seem to be looking for people that are compelling, good speakers, to make ""shows"" with using the production companies, in order to become ""influencers"" and therefore sell more of all the above ""courses""

ok, so this story is weird. i pulled into a gas station to buy disinfectant spray. as i’m walking out, a shady looking character walks in and asks me “hey man, is that your white car out there?”  

i say yes. 

he says: “there’s money hanging out of the trunk”

i say wtf

i walk outside while the shady character shows me that a $50 bill and two $20 bills are neatly tucked into the space where my trunk and rear windshield meet on a 4 door sedan (not an suv)

i pick up the money flabbergasted and tell him that this is not my money, nor is there anyway imaginable that it could’ve been placed there for me. he tells me it’s my lucky day, i tell him i don’t want this money because it’s not mine. and he says i’ll take it. he takes the money and walks in the store. i leave. wtf

am i crazy for thinking what the hell just happened? has anyone heard of this being some sort of scam? and if it wasn’t him, who in the hell put that money there? i haven’t stopped thinking about what the hell happened or what that guy was up to. please let me know if anyone has experienced anything similar to this."

"brute impact - a small instagram influencer scam i have a vanity instagram account, i'm gonna be honest.   
i'm really shy in person, but the whole ""social media influencer"" shtick is so interesting to me that i post selfies of myself doing crazy makeup in the hopes that maybe one day i'll make it there.  (doubtful, but it's still fun to do in the meantime.) it's a passion, it's a hobby, but i'm not about to flood my main insta with selfie after selfie.   


anyways, to the point of this post because there hasn't been a lot on this one brand in particular that i was personally able to find.   


brute impact fashion.   
they reached out to me today via a dm on instagram. now my first thought is, here's my chance! my rise to fame. my segway into the world of influencers! they have a good following, over 100k, a pretty legit looking insta, and a pretty legit looking website. their products are very artsy, and i'm digging one sweatshirt in particular, and then it hits me: i see a hoodie that i've seen before through my many perilous ventures on the internet. it's a cute hoodie - one that i've contemplated buying many times, but always put it off because of the \*eh\* reputation of the online retailer (ali express) and kept on moving. then there is my next thought: i have less than 100 followers on this vanity account, so why me? my gut is telling me this is a scam.   


doing a quick reverse google image search, my gut feeling is further solidified.   


&amp;#x200b;

![img](6pixbc31qpq41 ""here is the hoodie, advertised on brute impacts website - $160. now, the brand offer that was given to me was \""we'll give you a 50% off code for any of our items, you purchase the item, post a picture on instagram, we'll feature you, and you become a 'brand ambassador' with your own code that allows others to get our products at a discounted rate. you'll earn 30% commission of every item sold using your ambassador code.\"""")

reverse image search solidified my previous recollection.   


&amp;#x200b;

![img](z9dxfrs5rpq41 ""blank walls, another brand, is offering the hoodie at $79.99, discounted from $124.99. i have never heard of this brand and don't know if they're reputable or not. who knows! no shade to them. "")

and right next to the above, was ali express. 

![img](e0rsklifrpq41 ""this product, that bif was advertising for a whopping $160 was being sold for $31.50, reduced from $52.50."")

&amp;#x200b;

is this a mlm scam? looks like it. is it a scam? i dunno how legit their website is or the quality of the product you'd be receiving. i do know that they're selling a product that is ridiculously marked up, and when i provided these prices to them they defended it under the guise of ""we know the price is high, but our stores availability makes it worth it."" ???  


for small time influencers, or someone much like myself who just does it to be doing it, keep in mind and be cautious when making deals with companies like this, especially if a legal contract ever becomes involved. if you're feeling brave and want to take the risk, go for it! it's your money and who's to tell you no?   


anyways, this post was not made to negatively damage the above mentioned brands, just to bring awareness to the possibility that it is a scam, and/or not worth the invested time/money."

"scammed over a fake id after it already being made? here’s the gist, i purchased a fake id from someone here on reddit. (the id is a parody of my friend i was getting as a gift for his bday, not for the intent to be used but for novelty and laughs). 

he seemed extremely professional throughout the whole ordering process and even sent me a long email explaining how he doesn’t want me to pay until i saw my id on video first. a day passes and he emails me back with the video of the id all finished and passing all the various tests. 

however, this is where things get weird. the only payment method he sought for was through a reloadit card, something i’ve never even heard of. had to go through the trouble of going to the store to find one of these cards too because you can’t buy them online. after i paid him, since i was sure this wasn’t a scam because he literally made the id, all contact from him ceased. 

it has now been over 24 hours since he has stopped responding and i’m disappointed. obviously, i shouldn’t have trusted someone on this platform to follow through on any sort of business but, considering his marketing, i thought it was worth a shot.

i have his reddit username, email, and phone number. there is still a possibility that the id could come within the next few days, but with his strange antics in mind, i don’t have much faith. i’m extremely upset at myself for wasting a decent amount of money on something i was sure i was going to get. i am open to chatting more about this privately or would like to hear some thoughts from other people because i truly can’t believe someone would make a fake id and not follow through with shipping it."

"this sub, and my gut prevented me from getting scammed i have been successfully scammed once when i was a teenager by the ""white van scam,"" where a guy ""gets an extra speaker"" for a home installation job and sells it to you for an insane discount.  the feeling of being scammed felt so shitty, that i never wanted to feel that again, or have others experience it.  cue to today.  i received a call from the ""fraud dept"" of my credit union.  they said their were unusual transactions, and they read two supposed attempted transactions that were halted due to them being made in a zip code so far from my home address.  i confirmed those were not legit purchases.  that should have been that, but then the scam kicked in.  the guy said that to send me my new card it would be $25 for expedited shipping, but they could wave the fee.  i said do or don't, i will use my credit card in the meantime so it didn't matter.  then the scammer started to get my card information backward.  first he wanted the last four digits.  then the expiration.  then the last eight.  at this time my gut told me something was up.  i gave him a bit of fake info so i could jump on my laptop to look things up.  my account was fine with no charges; however the number he called from, was from my credit union.  i asked him to report to me my recent transactions, and he told me he did not have that info because the only thing he can see are the fraudulent charges.  i think he sensed me figuring things out, and did something very concerning.  to prove to me he was with the fraud dept and was looking at my account, he told me my address and full social security number.  i remember someone saying on the subreddit to simply hang up and call back the bank.  i did, and sure enough it was a scammer.  i had my account locked.  my concern is the scammer telling me my ssn and address. what do i need to do?"

how do the logistics of this work? most of these people are online. i can create a website and ask for a deposit. but how do you avoid getting scammed? how do i know how much to charge? is this taking away from actual tattoo artist?

"has anyone used skrill? i've been doing work on a website where the only quick option of cashing out is to use skrill. i set up my account a week ago and am still going through the verification process. i've called customer service almost every day and at first they told me to try and upload my drivers license again. when that didn't work they told me to email a picture of my passport directly to their email. i did that and then no one got back to me. finally i tried again on the 1st and was able to upload my passport but now every time i log in the wait time for them to verify my account goes up. it's been days and i'm still at 8 hours until verification (it goes up and down every time i log in). 

you need to deposit money before you can get verified (shady, i know) so i have about $30 in the account and about $100 on the site that i work for that i can't move because i don't want to add more without my account being verified. i've read some reviews on this company and a lot of people have the same problem as me but with much more money stuck in their accounts for various other reasons. 

i have no idea why the site i work for (mygirlfund) would partner with a site that seems to be a scam but they (mgf) have thousands of girls working for them so surely it works for some people? if anyone has any information on skrill i would really appreciate some feedback.

tl;dr: skrill won't verify my account and i have money in there. does anyone have any experience with this company?"
"social media sextortion (facebook, skype, etc.) you have to report these incidents to the fbi crime complaint center (www.ic3.gov). the reason is that the criminal will use your video to blackmail other people. criminals use video of their victims in the live chat. you suspect that you are live with someone, but that is not the case. you do not want to pay the criminal because there is no guarantee that your nude video will be deleted. many years from now, it might resurface and hunt you when you become someone important. your best choice is to provide information and evidence (a copy of the messages you have with the scammer, etc.) to the ic3. once the ic3 team gathers enough information, they can indict the criminals. the more complaints the better because there will be more evidence and information for the investigators to crack down on these crooks. as a community, we must report these personal incidents to increase the indictment of these predictors. watch this video [https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/ic3-psa-kirsten-vangsness.mp4/view](https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/ic3-psa-kirsten-vangsness.mp4/view)

"update: how did this scam happen and how did they get my father's credit card info? i have figured out everything that i posted about yesterday in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/scams/comments/fu1g7w/how\_did\_this\_scam\_happen\_and\_how\_did\_they\_get\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/scams/comments/fu1g7w/how_did_this_scam_happen_and_how_did_they_get_my/)

as others have mentioned, my dad probably clicked on an ad instead of an actual search result which is what started the wheels in motion. that part answers one of my two main questions, so thanks to all who suggested that.

the other thing i wasn't sure about was: how did they get my dad's credit card information?

after the scammer gained access to my dad's computer, he was able to roam free on there without anyone noticing because my dad had physically stepped away when he became suspicious. he went upstairs to go tell my mom what was going on, and make some phone calls.

within the 15-20 minutes he was unattended, the scammer was able to:

* reset the password on my dad's amazon account (which he didn't even know existed)
* access [outlook.com](https://outlook.com) e-mail due to the ""stay signed-in"" feature and receive the forgot password and otp e-mails
* (here's the missing piece) find out my dad's credit card by editing saved payment methods in google chrome. his chrome isn't linked to any google account so payment methods are stored locally in the browser and not on google pay ([pay.google.com](https://pay.google.com)). in google pay, you can't see the full card number even when you edit a card on file, but when the card is stored locally in the browser, you can see the name, card number and expiry date. that's enough to add that card as a payment method in amazon
* add the card as a payment method in amazon
* send himself a $100 gift card

mystery solved!

thanks everyone."

"after being promised a job, i found out that the company i applied for is a fraud. i already gave them my sin card info. what should i do? i'm a resident in canada and i was looking for a job in usa. after being contacted by a company in india, which sends people from all over the world to work in usa, i was promised a job with them. they asked me for my sin number and i sent it to them. after being asked some suspicious questions and upon further research, i've come to the conclusion that the company is a fraud so i decided to reject the job offer. once i told them i do no want to work for them, they asked me for my passport information which is very strange. is there a risk for identity theft? if i change or cancel my sin number, will that be enough?"

"nothing like getting scammed during a pandemic! (kinda venting but hoping to help anyone else who might have been scammed) so, i’ve been looking for a used nintendo switch since the new animal crossing game released. found a few in my price range on facebook marketplace but by the time i messaged the sellers, they’d all been sold. i decided after two weeks of that to try to branch out to reddit. i got a few offers but decided to message this one person back because they could do it for a little below my initial asking price and they apparently needed insulin because of the pandemic. had a long conversation with them through reddit chat, we agreed on a price and it turned out they were only about an hour away from me so i asked if i could pick it up instead of shipping. they then said they’d have to ask their husband and that was it for the night. next morning, i get word that my state has gone into lockdown quarantine and making the trip would be next to impossible. i also couldn’t have it shipped because i have three immuno-compromised people in my house. i let the person know, said sorry i bunch and that was that for a few days. my dad agreed to let it be shipped a few days later so i messaged the person to see if they still had it. they did and we agreed on a down payment and shipping that i would pay then thru cash app and then send the rest once the switch got here. they said it would be here either tuesday or wednesday depending on if the quarantine slowed down the mail or not. i said great! i ask the next day for the tracking number but they say they left the paper in their sister’s car. i say okay no problem just get it to me when you can. they then ask a few hours later if i could send a bit more cause they were so close to getting their insulin. i said i couldn’t cause i was waiting for some money to get from my paypal to my bank account. that was it for the day. over the weekend, my mom and i did a harry potter weekend so i was kind of ignoring my phone but when i checked, the person requested $20 for the insulin and to let me know that their reddit account had gotten deleted. so, stupid me sends them a dollar asking how to get in contact with them. nothing for the rest of the day. tuesday comes, no switch. wednesday comes, no switch. i send them another dollar because that’s the only way i can write a note to them. i ask for the tracking number and they respond “i guess the switch didn’t show. send me email addr” i did (another dollar) and got a thumbs up back. then nothing. i tried emailing them using the email they gave me for their googlepay. nothing back. it’s now friday and i haven’t heard from them since wednesday. i just feel so stupid. i know it was my fault for trusting someone over the internet but i just ugh. i didn’t mention their username because their account got deleted but i still have it in our chat and i have their cash app username. i’m trying to report them to cash app and possibly googlepay but i don’t think it’ll do much. please learn from my mistake and don’t let someone take advantage of you like they did me. thanks.

"possible freelance scam - advice? hello everyone, 
i've lost my job right before the covid-19 took off in my country. since finding a new job is going to be virtually impossible for me now, i've also started looking into freelance jobs on freelancer. i've placed a bid for a virtual assistant position and i've been messaged by them. here is why i am scared it might be a scam:

- it was advertised as a virtual assistant position for a moving company, but the supposed hiring manager on hangouts introduces her company as a pharmaceutical company - is this maybe some sort of a bug that freelancer has? 

- i've gotten the job, and they said their practice is for the new employee to buy the training software from their vendor through paypal, which would be refunded with the first pay cheque.

- after getting the job she sends me the message: ""pending the time the contract letter will arrived, i got message from the vendor asking how soon would you be willing to make the payments for your training software so they can start sorting them out immediately"" 
and today she sends me basically the same message:
""i got message from the vendor asking how soon would you be willing to make the payments for your training software so they can start sorting them out immediately""
i wouldnt be so worried about all of this if my stupid self hasn't given her my adress.

if anyone on this thread has any sort of advice, experience, or knowledge on this kind kind of stuff i would greatly appreciate it if you shared it with me. did i make a huge mistake or am i just paranoid?"

"my dumb ass got pretty close to getting scammed this morning as i woke up this morning, i was greeted with a text message from supposedly paypal. i checked the message and it seemed like paypal had sent me messages through the same number before, so, without checking whether i had been sent messages through a different paypal number too (which i had), i clicked the link like an idiot. this brought me to a supposed paypal page ([picture here](https://imgur.com/a/dax3eke)). it was only here that i started getting suspicious, as the site's link wasn't related to paypal at all (which i could've seen from the text, but red flag #1 regardless).  


following this, i checked my e-mail to see if i hadn't gotten anything, which i didn't (red flag #2). thinking there may still be a chance that it's real, i checked my paypal account, which didn't mention anything related to it (red flag #3 and pretty definitive proof that it's a scam). luckily at this point i realised that no transaction existed, but it's scary how close i got to clicking that link and no doubt accepting some transaction that would be real and irreversible, or getting my paypal info stolen.

so i’m in ca trying to get unemployment. it’s impossible to reach them in the phone. in the unemployment subreddit there was an email for numerous edd members

i emailed all of them, 2 responded. one asked for my number and said someone from ui would reach out 

these are all @edd.ca.gov emails

i got a phone call saying it was someone from ui, a private number. he asked for my social and i let him know i can’t do that without verifying info so he said i emailed this person at edd and the email was forwarded to him and he was told to reach out. and again this is all through @edd.ca.gov emails

we do discussed my unemployment options, he told me he would add me to the call log for tomorrow to be called by edd

he also gave me his number name and his title. i can’t find much on him except on zoominfo which verified what he told me

 [https://www.facebook.com/trippytaps](https://www.facebook.com/trippytaps) 

this person bought dirt cheap wholesale tapestries from alibaba/aliexpress, and is committing fraud by advertising that they are ""going out of business"", when in reality, they just created/registered their website domains a couple weeks ago. i believe they are all owned by the same person, because they all use the same photos of an easily recognizable man (short, brown skin, black hair, same hair style) holding up the tapestries. not to mention the domains were registered within a month or two of each other.

selling wholesale isn't the problem here obviously, the issue is the complete lack of reputable business etiquette. they are blatantly lying about going out of business, so that they can mark down their items as being 65% off, when they're actually being sold at their regular price. the tapestries are being sold for 15 dollars, but are listed as being 45 dollars originally. other wholesellers are also selling these same tapestries at that price (15 dollars), so that is where i get the word ""regular price"" from. even though they're actually only worth 2-4 dollars each on alibaba and aliexpress...

i understand that up-selling is the entire point of buying in bulk, that part is ""fine"", but the problem arises from the blatant lies and shady business practices. i'm not positive, but isn't advertising that you're going out of business **illegal** if you're not actually closing?

anyways, just thought i would warn others who maybe wouldn't feel good about supporting a scammer/fraud."

"desperate for cancer medication? don't fall for this scam- onlinecancerpharm.com recently, i was looking for a way to obtain a cancer medication for a cheaper price. many cancer medications are extremely expensive in the us today. i know that many generic medications can be found online via foreign pharmacies or pharmacies that fly under the radar online. i was googling my medication of interest and on the first few pages a website called [onlinecancerpharm.com](https://onlinecancerpharm.com) showed up. i decided check out the website, and for the most part it looked like it was professional, even though it had generic stock photos of people in the health field and shitty font. it even had a live chat server where people actually responded. however there were a few things that were amiss. first, they list a fake address in san francisco and phone number that doesn't work(but i didn't call it at first). however, this did not dissuade me because i knew that purchasing cancer medications without a doctor's prescription was illegal (i need my meds though). in this business there are going to be people who are shady and trying to cover their identity for trying to sell these medications, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are scammers.

i decided to purchase the medication from the website. next, the transaction had to be carried out via whatsapp. on whatsapp, the person i was interacting with requested that i pay in bitcoins. again, with any illegal activity i expected that people want to use bitcoins since they are not trackable by the government. i ended up paying a couple hundred dollars for my medicine. i requested the tracking number for my order. the person i was interacting with in whatsapp said that he mailed the package the next day and provided me with the tracking number. the website he linked me to was a site called ""pacific network express."" i had never heard of this courier, but i know there are smaller couriers who will deliver packages such as lasership used by amazon, so again, i didn't feel completely cheated at this point. but then the next day, i tried tracking my package and the website showed that my package was ""on hold,"" for no reason. there was a message at the bottom of the tracking site that said to remove the on hold status i would have to pay for $490. then i notice the same livechat program being used as on [onlinecancerpharm.com](https://onlinecancerpharm.com). finally i realized that i was scammed.

i guess the best scam is the one you seek out yourself. and i always prided myself on not getting cheated or phish'd, but today for the first time in my life, i was scammed. i want to alert everyone out there who may be desperate for cancer medication that you should not fall for this website. they devised a very elaborate scam. as soon as i saw the fake san francisco address, i should have known and shut down my desire to try and buy from this website. now i am out a few hundred dollars without my medicine because of these assholes. 

&amp;#x200b;

**my best guess is that these guys are probably operating out of pakistan or nigeria, based upon their poor english in my correspondence with them, but is there any recourse i have? is there anyway to get this site shutdown, so no one ever has to get scammed like this again?** 

&amp;#x200b;

**tldr:** [onlinecancerpharm.com](https://onlinecancerpharm.com) is a scam. do not try to order cancer medications from them if you need to get cheaper medications."
"(handvana/healthvana*/hempvana) hydroclean hand sanitizer is not alcohol-based and uses false advertising to scam you out of your money! wednesday morning, i saw a commercial for hydroclean from a company claiming to be ""healthvana"" (whom i later found out was using the real healthvana's trademarked name), now known as handvana (company changed their name 19+ hours ago), promoting their ""new hand sanitizer that kills germs and hydrates skin."" i immediately thought to myself, ""something seems fishy,"" and made a mental note to do some research on this later. i guess the entity behind hydroclean sanitizer thought it would be a great time to take advantage of the vulnerable public and rake in a bunch of dough. how nice of them. now i'm returning the favor by calling them out.

as if the infringement of a reputable company's name wasn't enough of a red flag, i found that the social media links on hydroclean's webpage, https://healthvanafoam.com, leads to pages used by the company bulbhead. hmmm...that's suspicious. oh yeah, hempvana, llc is the parent company of n.k.a. handvana. interestingly, i just found that hydroclean has a brand facebook page started on march 18, 2020 and they updated their webpage on march 30, 2020 at 1:30 to https://myhydrocleangel.com, but unless you click this link through their facebook post, you will get a 404 error. it's also worth noting that the very last sentence of their new website still shows the company name as healthvana and fraudulently shows the trademark symbol beside it, and their old website uses the name healthvana in the address but the very last sentence on this page shows the company as handvana. 

the commercial and information found on hydroclean's website makes some dangerous and irresponsible statements that are designed to mislead and confuse consumers by suggesting it is a high quality product and, based on the opportune timing of its march 2020 marketing, that it is safe and effective in the fight against covid-19. is it? let's see.

the commercial states that hydroclean is made with ""an ingredient from an fda registered facility that kills 99.9% of germs so trusted that it is used for surgical prep in hospitals."" a few seconds later we see a man presented as a doctor stating that hydroclean ""uses the same ingredient that is used in hospital pre-op care"" but he recommends the product ""because of the added moisturizers."" so, while hydroclean claims to be a powerful product that seems to be approved by the fda and so trusted it's used in hospitals, the fake doctor only recommends it because of its moisturizers. really? 

so, is hydroclean powerful enough to kill the germs we're presently concerned with? let's look at the product ingredients, which include a combination of - benzalkonium chloride, aloe vera, coconut oil, and hyaluronic acid. the problem here is the use of benzalkonium chloride, making hydroclean a non alcohol-based sanitizer. the cdc recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol to reduce the number of germs on hands when washing them with soap and water is not readily available. 

hydroclean's website further misleads customers by suggesting this specific product has over 100 million satisfied customers and has been a trusted brand since 2015. if 100 million satisfied customers used this product then how come i cannot find any reviews? and i'm not sure which brand they speak of because i am so confused now that i'm done looking into this shady ass product.

"fake merchant? fixthed.store &amp; pellucidy.com i saw an ad on fb for a nintendo switch + 3 games for $128 and thought this has to be a scam. it was [here](https://fixthed.store/shopping/uncategorized.html/nintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joy%e2%80%91con-hac-001-01-include-three-games%ef%bc%88the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wildsuper-smash-bros-ultimatemario-kart-8-deluxe%ef%bc%89/) on [fixthed.store](fixthed.store). i started poking around their site. all of their ""about"" pages refer to themselves as ""[pellucidy.com](pellucidy.com)""?? which is also a real domain that has just as little info online and looks like a clone. the stores look pretty legit and i didn't find much with a whois search. if they are illegitimate, how would they scam someone who tried to buy something from them? i'm not familiar with how fake merchants work."

buying a nintendo switch on alibaba? so my friend found a seller that’s selling nintendo switch consoles for about usd210 on the site. they’re selling them wholesale (min. 6 pcs) and the seller's sourced in vietnam. the pictures seem believable since they came back with no results when i tried to do a reverse image search. alibaba has their refund policy but i'm not sure if i want to risk it without consulting more people. is this likely to be a scam?

"buyer paid using venmo, then cancelled telling venmo it was a wrong payment hello so i recently sold a ps4 on offerup and decided to use venmo for the transaction. the buyer met in person with me and i was able to receive the total amount to my venmo account. 

a few days later, the buyer told me the ps4 was not working well and was seeking legal action, then i received an email from venmo stating the buyer claimed the original payment as “a wrong payment”

venmo deposited the money as credit into my account, and then used it along with whatever i had in my balance to pay them back. the thing is, i had already mostly deposited the amount to my bank account.

venmo claims there is no further action to be done on my behalf, but i’m afraid they’ll charge me for the amount. any help?"

"suntrust bank email scam the scammers are now just trying to get your personal information. found this in my  spam folder.

so many things wrong with the email:

1.) the senders email address is not a ""suntrust bank"" email address.

2.) they use ""dear customer"" instead of your name, etc.

3.) bad grammar.

4.) bad punctuation.

5.) the link shows ""suntrustcn .com"" when hovered on (suntrustcn is not part of the suntrust bank site, but they tried to make it look like it).

6.) the dire urgency to verify 'personal information' or your account would be suspended or canceled. banks, etc. do not ask for personal info via email.

7.) i don't even have a suntrust account."

"if something is too good to be true... it is. and now i don't think i'll be able to get my fiance the birthday dinner i promised him. heya, 

a very tired fourth-year computer science university student here. let me put my day in a nutshell.

this morning i had a few calls/emails from various companies interviewing me for work from home/remote opportunities. all's good and well. among them i get an email from a company i hadn't applied to, but the ""hiring manager"" said he'd seen my resume as it was posted on a job board. sure, i've had that happen before. he wants a text based interview on whatsapp. a little odd, i've never heard of that. a quick google search says its a growing trend, though, so yay!

i go into my ""interview"", and things start off fine. they ask me the pre screening questions. everything so far is going well. during my interview i look up the company and it seems to be a legit company based in the us and canada. cool. they offer me $30/hour, a whole $10 more than what i was typically paid at the university i work for. exciting! they also offer me $2000 to buy office equipment for my home office. when can i start? immediately, once my equipment is set up. so far, it all seems legit. it's so exciting. i tell my mother.

about 3 hours later they send me my cheque over email. so now i'm thinking, wow, this has to be legit. what kind of scam sends you money? i deposit it with e-deposit. the money is in my bank. all is well. i have $2132. hell yeah. they want a confirmation to know i receive the money. i send it without thinking. 

they tell me to go buy itunes giftcards as i'll need some apple apps to work for them. sure that's great. i buy the cards. they want to know the numbers after i've scratched the back. sure. i'm so excited and lost with this great new job opportunity that i just... don't realize what i'm doing. 

and then after buying these cards and sending them the numbers, they ask for others, and now the inkling of suspicion grows in me. my card for the next purchase is maxed out (impossible). i am now on high alert realizing what i got into. my bank confirms they froze my account due to suspicious activity. i am... i guess i should have seen it. but i didn't. i dont understand how scammers got to me through a reputable job listing site, but they did. but they did. and now they have: 
-$100  from their ill gotten giftcards 
-my bank account number 
-my name 
-my address 
-my phone number
-my email address 

i am terrified now of identity theft. i have to talk to the bank tomorrow of course to see what steps i can do to protect my information now. i am terrified of them taking more money from me. i am exhausted and tired. i guess i lost sight of the risks because i lost all three of my part time jobs due the virus and i am desperately trying to make ends meet, and a golden opportunity fell into my lap. golden opportunities do not exist. i should know better. 

now on top of yknow our very livelihood being threatened... i had promised my fiance that i'd get him one of his favourite items from his favourite restaurants on his birthday late april. i don't think i can do that anymore. lmao. forget ordering out, i can't even get a water filter pitcher that i was gonna order tomorrow. i'm tired, and drained, and more than that i'm defeated and i feel like my hope is crushed. the people who scam don't care, i know, but i was literally a broke university student with barely $100 in her account. and now i've kinda got nothing (financially). my fiance is doing his best to comfort me, and i'm thankful to have him (but ngl i want actual cuddles, we're long distance and the whole virtual snug thing sucks right now). 

advice on how to protect my information right now until i can get things sorted out would be appreciated. yes, i filed a police report, but i doubt it will do much."

"nothing like a pandemic to bring out the worst was looking to see if there was any hand sanitizers online. noticed a google ad for a company using the site, swisspharmax.com offering hand sanitizer. i ordered 4 as my mother has cancer and going into hospital and she is terrified so i said would order some. i already have masks etc but she is 80 and terrified of catching the virus while getting cancer surgery.

after 2 minutes i got a gut feeling i just did something thick. i looked at the about us section. it stated they were in business since 1998. so i looked up the domain and company, turns out it was set up 25/02/2020. there is one director living in lithuania. the address of the office was a virtual address that throws in a phone number for almost nothing. am normally very careful and to date i never got stung, but my guard was down.

i  then noticed it had 4 domain names, swisspharmax.com, swisspharmax.co.uk, swisspharm.fr and santiserspro.uk. all websites are identical,  all say the same crap, about doing business since 1998. there is a swiss pharma group that is legitimate and a swiss pharma in india. on facebook they call themselves swisspharmax gmbh. for a company that is suppose to be in existence since 1998 it has 19 likes. it was blocked reviews and blocked and deleted my comments when i asked for a refund.

it is on scamdoc with 4 positive reviews. 3 reviews were made within minutes of each other on the same day. so lazy used the name joanne twice. although the company is trading since 1998, 4 reviews were done on the same day, the 3rd of march 2020. 

i have contacted the appropriate organisations and have kissed goodbye to my money. 

just wanted others not to make the same error of judgement."

"debt collection scam? hi this is my first time posting here and i realized i may have been scammed into paying a company that doesn't even exist anymore. i realized i was scammed by cs industries and only found out when i had to cancel my debit card and get a new one because i lost it that this company doesn't exist when i tried to find their contact number on google and couldn't find anything but a bunch of beware of scammer articles! i called my bank and they are going to refund the last 90 days i sent money (about 300, in all will be out of 900 since i was paying 150/month since sep 2019). they had called me saying they are about to process the litigation and take me to court over a debt i owed and to stop it they can set up a payment plan now, of course being the naive scared dumbass i am i went ahead and gave them my debit card number, expiration, and security code. that is being dealt with. 

i am now looking at another company now that i finished paying off (smaller amount, just 495). since this happened i am now looking and seeing if this was a scam too. i asked for a validation of debt and they sent me this

i was busy at the time and didn't actually look at it, but now i'm seeing the client isn't even a real bank? there is something called ""service credit union"" without the s, but i never had an account with them. also paramount processing group, llc doesn't even look like a real collection agency.

can anyone tell me whether i've been scammed here as well? i am really embarrassed and ashamed of this but i really can't afford to be screwed out of so much money, especially since i've become a dad recently. i can probably get back all this money since its been within 90 days at least if it is."
"what do you guys think? scam or no? so, about an hour ago (on my main account) i made a post in r/assistance. i needed help buying some necessities and wanted to see if any kind person would be willing to give me $40 that i could pay back this friday. this guy messages me and asks for my paypal, i give it to him and he sends me $50. great! i was so appreciative and thankful. so we continue talking and he asks me if i would be willing to make a little more extra money doing some of his side gigs that he pays for. he told me it was similar to amazon mechanical turk which i use very often, so i agree. he gives me his number and i text him asking him what exactly is it that he does. he told me that he needs my apple id and password to use an app that collects my geodata so he can study it and put it in his projects. he seems very nice and genuine and after all, he did send me $50 for no reason. but, this whole thing seems so sketchy. with my apple id he could access all of my photos, history, pretty much everything. i haven’t given it to him and i don’t really plan on it but i’m questioning if i’m doing the right or wrong thing. i’ve never heard of this before."

"remote job offer - is it a scam? hello, first time posting here and i need some help. i just got a job offer to work from home with a company called  ""swiss post solutions"" their website looks okay and i saw glassdoor and indeed reviews about the company. what is throwing me off is that they only email me back at the oddest hours like 5-6am. after i sent them my resume they said i was qualified to do customer support/ tech support from home. once i accepted the offer, they wanted my full name, mobile (both on my resume) and my mailing address. they said i would need to buy equipment to work from home which includes a computer, security printer, voip phone, virtualassistpro, paper and ink. they said i would buy those things from a check for $3000 which would be mailed to my house and i would be given instructions on where to order from. that raised red flags for me so i am not sure what to do. i accepted the offer and am waiting 2 weeks for the check to come in. please let me know what to do and if this is a scam. i couldn't find relevant information using google."

"transavia s.r.l. contract job if the void or real? scammer   i recently signed a contract with this company transavia s.r.l  i had an italian woman e-mail me (and later call me a few times) and say she found my resume and profile and that i would be a perfect match to work at her company. they needed people who could become logistic coordinator and i could do this job from home.  as she stated  the salary is $3000.00 per month, it's always paid monthly by paper check which is mailed to you. the salary is paid every month on the same day when you are hired, i.e. every 30 days. your commission is 7% from each successful deal. i.e. from each closure that you have with your customers. but the commission is paid separately, it's not paid together with the salary, it's paid to you every time you have a closure. so once again, the salary is monthly and the commission is throughout the month, so it's up to you. besides, i should remind you that since this is 1099 employment, both the salary and the commission are before taxes, and you do your taxes yourself. 1099 tax form will be forwarded to you once a year, when it is time to report taxes.

benefits provided:  
as far as the employment agreement goes, you will have the following benefits:  
\-  20 days of paid vacation a year;  
\-  all state holidays (such as independence day, christmas, thanksgiving and so on) are always days-off, so we never work on holidays and we never call customers on holidays because it's not professional;  


after the first assignment, i found out that is could be a scam as the check had a different name when she told me that this check will be from a bank but it turned out to be a bakery instead. 

and she wanted me to do this s per the agreement terms with our clients, they are entitled to choose one of the following payment methods: via wire transfers, by check or a money transfer via p2p systems if there is a need to send money to our european branches. but our company can receive directly only several types of payments - wire transfers and money transfers via p2p systems. our clients have also the right to make payment by check, and since us checks cannot be cashed overseas as expediently as it can be done in the usa, plus due to the fact that the network of our american banking subsidiaries is undeveloped yet and currently our us-european banking system is just being adjusted to work properly, we need this kind of assistance from our us representatives on an irregular basis. first of all, it helps to cater our customers' needs in a most timely manner, and additionally our managers can have their commission and the whole company can have income in general. so initially, as part of your work duties, you will be assisting us with processing advance payments from our clients. therefore, please take your time to read it carefully because it contains the step-by-step instructions and you, as the new employee, have the chance to demonstrate your diligence and productivity which will greatly aid your career in our company.

the first stage (the process of getting the payment):  
1. our customer receives an invoice for services they previously ordered in the form approved by our company, they negotiate the amount of the first payment;  
2. from our part we are appointing you, as the responsible employee, to support this assignment and further customer's payment processing;  
3. our client sends the payment and the copy of the invoice by mail through usps to your home address, pre-paying for postage. the delivery takes 1-2business days if there are no unintended delays (bad weather conditions, troubles in the usps distribution centers, etc.)

please see below full information about our customer who will send you the payment:

***the check will be from: bimbo bakeries usa inc.***  
***the sum on it: $2490.47***

the second stage (the process of handling the payment):  
1. as soon as you get the payment by check you should cash it. it is worth noting that based on our practice, walmart or check cashing desks do not always cash personal checks and out of state checks, and most importantly these institutions have been manifoldly accused of misuse of personal banking information the access to which they are given when they cash checks. which is why we recommend you to process the payment at your or customer's bank. you can also deposit the check if your bank does not allow you to cash the payment in 1 business day, this procedure usually takes up to 48 hours.  
2. you take your commission as per terms of your salary-plus-commission remuneration system.  
3. once the check is fully cashed, you should send me a notice of funds availability. then i will prepare further instructions (how and where to send the funds to) in accordance with the recommendations of our financial department. (note: further instructions always depend on our financial department, client's order and destination). please don't worry i'll send you detailed instructions. at this point, it is highly important to transfer the funds and officially seal the deal within 2 days since the money is available to you.  
4. once you receive the instructions, you should follow them and complete the assignment as soon as possible and send the report to me. all transaction fees are paid from the amount received. so i kept ignoring her emails or make the email bounce back as it is not in service a fake bounce back email . 

&amp;#x200b;

but she sent me this email that if i didn't do it they will do a lawsuit 

unfortunately, you haven\&amp;#39;t completed the assignment, and this situation significantly spoils our business reputation. please, understand that your poor performance puts our sales to a stop and endangers our operations in general, particularly in the usa. so, we recommend you 3 ways:  


first way:  


you transfer the funds today to our receiver as per instructions: you take your remuneration and pay the money transfer fees from our part of funds. after that you send me a full report and we will forget about this incident and you will be able to continue your work with us.  


second way:  


you take only your remuneration with an additional $150.00 as the final compensation and transfer the rest of money to our receiver, send me a full report. after that, as soon as the funds arrive, we forget about this incident and cancel the agreement not claiming our lawful right to demand from you compensation of damage. so, we will not continue working with you if you choose this way.  


third way (the worst for both parts):  


you don\&amp;#39;t transfer funds to our receiver and break the agreement terms. this way we contact the customer asking him to cancel the payment and we will file a suit and charge you for fees also (all attorney\&amp;#39;s fees and the penalties, which provided in paragraph #11 of our agreement, at the rate of 0.1% per day of the annual salary amount for each day of your inactivity). so i believe that the first and second way is the most suitable for you and for us. please let us know your final decision.  
 am not sure if this a real contract or fake and will they do anything to me that is the only reason am here"

he keeps delaying taking the exam and then recently passed. he showed me his pass screen, and then i congratulate him. i even check his verification code on the website. we exchange phone numbers cause i wanted to study with him for another cert.

then some weird red flags started to happen. 

he starts making grammatical spelling errors and mistakes. okay, whatever for the first few ones. overall, he keeps it kinda small (too vs to, well vs good) and only speaks in short sentences. when he writes more than a sentence or two, i don’t even understand what he is trying to say. then, he asks me to send him a photo of myself after sending me a photo of himself at work. i refuse. afterwards, he emails me through his work email. i say that i’m concerned cause the work email should be for work only, not talking about daily life. then recently he asks me whether/why i’m not dating. i have never talked to this person beyond talking about it or told him about my personal life, other than telling what hobbies i have (singing and art). i also don't know this person personally.

i feel creeped out and am beginning to think the person is not who they say they are. i don't feel like talking to him anymore. has anyone has similar experiences and has it led up to anything annoying/bad? any advice?"

"help!! is this company legit i recently got a job offer from global database intelligence. they are based out of the uk. i looked up their website and it seemed legit, but i'm not certain.

 what's making me skeptical is the fact that i have no prior experience for what they want me to do. and the salary is way higher than what i feel it should be. the interview was done on google hangouts which is another red flag. and they sent me a check for $3600 to buy a laptop and desk and other stuff for a home office.  but the check was from a different company. i ask the guy i've been talking to about it and he said it is an affiliate of theirs. also the check didn't clear, my bank has tried it twice and it didn't clear either time. 

when i told the guy i've been talking to about this he said he would look into it. and i can't find much about them online.

"is it a scam? hi, i've recently stumbled upon an ad claiming that i could earn money for software testing.   
it is too good to be true but i've entered my fake data to test it and see how far can i go.  
the software is an online casino, and first i had to play for an hour for a demo version, for them to see if i can handle the user interface. they even show that for that hour you're paid about 20€.  
when the demo is over, they ask you to create a real account in the online casino. and then you get this step to do:

this scared me and i've decided not to go further. nobody should ask you to invest your own money into these things. i believe it's just a way of hooking you up to the game, or selling you some shitty story of how they've found a way to beat the casino's algorithm.

"my employer is a scammer. help me. hello. so, basically my employer is scamming his own employees and his clients. i have been offered much bigger salary than i've really got. they owes me money from past year. they offer guitar lessons for children, but a lot of their employees are just unfair, they finish lessons even 10-15 minutes before the end (whole lesson should be 45 min long), people say some of them don't know how to play guitar etc...

children's parents pay the same amount of money every month, no matter how many lessons will be canceled. people say their children's lessons were canceled for 2 whole months and they had to pay for it. what about my salary? i wasn't get paid this way. i was paid for every kid present on the lesson. so they money from lessons that don't take a place, i don't get anything. i've had to phone to them once/twice a week for 3-4 weeks to get part of my salary from past year. they still owes me some of it. i don't get paid for hours of work, just for amount of kids that comes to lessons and are signed up. few times i drove to the school, few kids showed up but nobody was signed up later. no money from this. oh, have i told you about the places i work? i was told i'll have to drive about 15km from home. well, it turned out it's about 30km. both ways = 50 to 70km, average 4 work days = about 1000kms per month. whatever, at least i improved my driving skills... yesterday i got a call from one of students. she told me they have online lessons now and asked why don't i conduct those lessons. i was shocked, i didn't even know about them. i haven't got any single message about it. about a month ago they said we'll have more lessons after the quarantaine ends. also they said i won't work till 25 march and they will give me know what will happen later. guess what? i got no message after that. i'm just sitting at home without job, without salary and i want to ruin that company.

and to do it, i need you. just type "" music &amp; more sp. z o.o. "" in your search engine and give it 1/5 rating. a lot of people look just at their average rating which is 3/5 at the moment (5/5 comes from bought ratings, lol). it'll mean less clients for them."

"instagram bot/failed love story/ corona virus it started out as the perfect love story. a beautiful woman slid into my dm’s one night and we hit it off. she wanted to know everything about me such as my favorite color, meal, if i own a house, live alone, drive myself, and own a house, yes she asked that twice. i started with a simple reverse image lookup using imgops.com along with all the beautiful images she provided and discovered that the images belonged to some instagram model, lucky me! then i used spokeo to verify her number which was located in indiana, which she said was pretty close to oregon where she is from. after she assured me that the instagram account with 500k followers was actually a fan account to her 30 follower account i told her she had my trust. the only issue was she claimed she did not have any food due to corona virus and i offered to order her groceries but she insisted she needed cash instead. i went along with her cashapp scam for quite a while but i accidentally kept hitting “request” instead of pay. she couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t working so unfortunately she couldn’t eat for the night. the next morning i wasted their time getting them to create multiple venmo accounts to try payments that way but to no avail every time i requested money from them there balance stood at $0. i was ready to say my goodbyes but then she asked me if i had been effected by the virus. after telling them how numerous family members have gotten it along with my grandfather who has just tested positive, she said i should be ashamed for not helping her. i wanted to know where these bots actually come from so i created a fake instagram account and came up with a story to get her to login for me. once she logged in i was able to see their location and instantly kick them back out. this one was from lagos, nigeria and when i confronted her about it she still made up more stories! after i listed all my evidence they insisted i was lying and that god will punish me for my actions. i will never understand how scammers can stick to their stories. hopefully me wasting their time for a couple days stopped them from finding someone gullible enough to fall for the scams.

"playerup scam website! hello.

first of all sorry for my horrible english.. im making this post so everybody makes sure not to use this scam website called playerup which supossedly offers a ""middleman service"" for online goods, such as videogames accounts, social media etc (instagram account in my case)

&amp;#x200b;

i got scammed by the website owners, not any random dude so thats why im making this post. gladly i have screenshots and proof of all this process..

basically what happened is this: i sold an instagram account to a random dude through their website using their service for 180 usd, (he paid for it and he got it instantly the same day) so after this i was told that i had to wait a few days to receive my payment, ok no problem with that, weeks went by and they said they were only giving me 156 usd because they get a % of the ammount we dealt which was a lie, the other dude already had payed up front, otherwise they dont do the middleman service if you dont pay first but whatever, at that point i at least wanted my 156 usd. months went by and i hardly got any response, at one point they said they had their paypal account limited and couldnt pay me so they wanted me to chose a different payment option (which sadly none of the ones they offered were useful for me) and kept on telling me to wait, now 3 months went by and i they no longer reply to me so i already know that i wont get to see my money. 

&amp;#x200b;

i will proceed to attach the screenshots so you guys can see, the conversations are way longer than this i only took screenshot of some parts but if someone else wants to see more just let me know and i will do it without any problem.

"getting kitchen repaired but pricing is not adding up. follow up to a post the other day here:

https://old.reddit.com/r/insurance/comments/fr0f9l/i_feel_my_parents_are_getting_ripped_off_on_a/

here's the kitchen (with measurements) in question: https://imgur.com/a/qycz7tk

total cost for just the custom in-built cabinet *boxes* (they're reusing the old fronts, drawers, doors, and hardware), ~42 sq/ft of custom formica countertops (not including backspash), and installation (not including demo and waste removal, that was $2,880) is being billed at $5,280.

so just a quick question...contractor came over yesterday after voicing our concerns with what was being done vs. what is being paid for.

contractor boss man made it very clear as i specifically asked what the countertops cost and he said ""$2,250"". not including backspash (that was an addition $450).

now i've been to home depot and lowes today and they both said that even for custom cut formica tops with 3/4 particle board and boarders at ~42 sq/ft using the best option they had shouldn't cost anymore if maybe *slightly* more than $1,000 but that would be on the higher end and that includes installation. i mean i have it now from multiple sources that work in this field that the countertops being over $1,000 is sort of high so what is $2,250?? 

contractor disagrees entirely and our somewhat heated discussion resulted in them agreeing that ""they guess"" they could get new casters for my parents reused and repainted drawers. it's tight for them though since apparently the remaining $3,000 of the $5,280 was apparently completely tied up. so he's saying these two items legit cost him over $5,000.

so ignoring all the other issues i posted the other day and just focusing on the one thing i can truly check pricing for myself, everything i'm coming up with is looking to be *less than half* of what they're charging. 

what, if anything, can i do about this? i feel like for that amount of money, whether it's to be returned to ""pre-loss condition"" or not should we at least a) not be able to get something nicer or b) not have to over pay these people and potentially gain return credit for future work?

or is contractors doing work way cheaper than what was paid just the name of the game?

insurance is paying $13,000 for this (plus new floors for just the kitchen at $3,000 for 300 sq/ft) and my folks had to pay $2,000 out of pocket...home depot guy said he could do new cabinet bottoms and tops and countertops with install and demo for $10,000. like...what?

anyways, just trying to get a bit more info or advice before i proceed with anything or talking in an official capacity to anyone. thanks!"

"mercari doesn't care about you the buyer so buyer beware sadly due to covid-19, my usual brand of cough drops were sold out all over town.  i use the strong menthol to help breathe with my damaged lungs.  it's a poor-man's treatment since i can't afford an $800 trip to the doctor.  so what's a gal to do?  order online eh?!  i found listings on amazon but the prices were through the roof.

but - i found an affordable listing on mercari, i've only used them twice before but the seller had good ratings and it was a good price.  i needed to get them.  when they arrived, i was so relieved.  i opened a bag, popped one in my mouth and....uuuuughhhh wth?!?!  it wasn't a cough drop anymore.  it was an inedible piece of plastic.  tasted like plastic.  crumbled like old plastic.  something was very wrong.  i looked at the bags - they were all expired.  expired january 2020 which means they were manufactured more than a year but probably more like 2 years ago.

this joker in ny who sold them to me has stored them in a plastic tub for years and during the world wide epidemic of the coronavirus decides he's going to sell them online.  so old that the plastic container they've sat in has seeped through two layers of packaging.

i go back to the seller, asked if he knew they were expired.  he gives me this bs line about how 'dual action kind tastes a bit funny, i'm sure they're fine'.  no dude.  i am probably the world's leading expert on these cough drops and i can assure you they are not fine.  so he's denying responsibility.  i double check the listing and guess what???

mercari doesn't allow the sale of food products, vitamins, cough drops, or anything edible on their site.  this fool in ny 'tabletoptrader' had listed them under 'videogames'.  so shame on me for not looking better.  and shame on me for being desperate i guess.

here's where it gets fun.  i contact mercari.  they're not taking calls, have to text them.  cool.  great. i text and say i want a refund - this jerk sold a fraudulent item and i want repercussions.  but you know what?  mercari didn't care.  they said, well you have 3 days to return the item to the seller ""because they have a right to their stuff back"".  oh he does?  he has a right to get his 2 year old expired cough drops back when he wasn't supposed to have sold them on your site in the first place?

okay so i'm under state mandated shelter in place.  i do not own a printer.  can they mail me the label? no - they won't.  they said they're a 'mobile app' and can't mail me anything.  now - they could have.  they could have found a way to help me get the return mailing label but they didn't want to.  they just want to make sure scammy mcscammerson gets his nasty plastic cough drops back.

so i went out to the ups store today, risked my life so i can get this crap sent back to ny and i just think others should really be careful when ordering online right now.  more careful than i was.  mercari doesn't care about you.  they're seller-centric and unlike ebay, they won't refund your money easily whatsoever.  

buyers beware."

i did the transaction via a credit card and as soon as i realized my mistake, i called them (capital one) to see what could be done, but they said i’d have to wait until the charge posted to dispute it and explain to their fraud team what happened.

is there anyway i’d get a chargeback? i authorized the purchase so i might be sol. it was for $89 so i wonder if it falls under the relevant federal act (can’t remember the name at the moment) since it’s over $50.

lesson learned.

"scammers can use your personal health information i got a really scary call yesterday, which got me really worried about my privacy. i have no idea, how the scammers were able to get this information. here is my experience:

i had an acl surgery last year, since it was an outpatient surgery i came back home after my surgery. however, after coming back home, i started feeling unbearable pain. as it was hard for my family to take me to a hospital, i had to call an ambulance to take me to the hospital. based on my knowledge, my insurance already paid for that ambulance bill and i do not owe anything. however, i still received a bill last month for my anesthasia, and it seems my insurance did not cover something.  now the scary part, i got a call from kentucky yesterday saying that i owe some money for the ambulance service. the insurance covered some money, but i still owe the rest. first, they told me my name and told me a random address to confirm my address. i suspected it could be a scam, so i did not give my correct address. i just said that, yeah it's correct (although i know it could be a  scam, i wanted to get additional information what it's about ). then, they told me the exact date of my ambulance service and the name of the hospital. more importantly, they also told me the total amount of the service (i did not remember the exact amount, but later i checked my eob it's exactly the same). they are claiming they are debt collectors and they already send me a paper copy to my address. at that point, i got scared and i started thinking i might still owe and it could be a negative thing for my record. i told them that i did not receive anything from any debt collecting agency. they told me if i want to settle it or not and how do i want to settle it? i told them i don't trust anything from a phone call, could they still send me a paper copy and options for settlement. they said that they don't have that time (this is when i was sure that it was a scam call). i told them, i have to check with my insurance first before making any payment, they said they can connect me to my insurance agency and can have a conference call. when they said that, i was confirmed that it was a scam and i cut the call. later, i checked my eob again and i was confirmed that i don't owe anything.

this scam actually made me really worried. i have no idea, how they knew about my health information. the only possible explanation could be my insurance agency sold my eob data/ the scammers have access to the public ambulance services information. my insurance is provided by my employer and it is one of the best insurance providers. so, it is hard to believe that they are selling my data so irresponsibly. beware of these scam calls."

"they charged me $3 randomly for about 3 months so i recently got a text from my credit card company, and checked my transactions online. around twice a month ish or so i was getting charged $3 from a very questionable source, it said in the details it was a ""direct marketing"" company. the only information provided was a very weird website name, and a phone number.  
 [https://fndvgh.com/](https://fndvgh.com/)   
that is the website. i doubt you'll get a virus from going on it, but if you don't want to view it and want the tldr or whatever, basically the home page is just a pic of some dude with a headset and they clearly want you to call their ""customer support"" number. poorly made too, theres just a button on top for reset password and cancel subscription. no details on services, nothing. 

so yeah check your transactions every now and then and look at the details, see if something looks fishy like this and report it. the company is sending me a new credit card now so these guys can't charge me for ??? things?"
"can anyone explain this facebook video scam? this just happened to one of my friends. i’m familiar with these types of scam messages but unsure how they work. here’s what happened:

1. friend receives link on facebook messenger from a friend with what appears to be a video link. accompanied with the standard “is this you?” message to encourage the victim to click on it.

2. friend clicks link on android phone, which goes to random site with no video. friend immediately closes page.

3. friend clicks link again on windows laptop - random site with no video. realises it could be a scam and closes page immediately.

4. a few hours later, friend realises the same link she received has been sent out to hundreds of her facebook friends from her own account.

the link was sent out at the exact same time to everyone.

questions:

is this a case of malware or phishing? 

how could her details have been compromised simply by clicking a link and not entering any information?

could this be a case of malware infecting her computer/phone and accessing her facebook? there are no obvious recent downloads to her computer...

she has changed her password and cleared cookies &amp; cache etc, but i’m trying to figure out how this scam works and what could be compromised simply through clicking a link... any thoughts on this would be much appreciated!"
"accidentally gave away my real name, address, &amp; phone number along with a fake email, birthday, &amp; gender to a scam site i saw a pop up ad in a game and thought the survey was on an lg site but then it redirected me to a site called amarktflow. i entered in my real name, address, &amp; phone number along with a fake email, birthday, &amp; gender.

"fake check, fake everything. hey guys, i wanted to come on here to talk about my story about how i almost fell through with a scam and i am currently still going through it would be nice to get your guys’ advice  and that have been in this situation.

being 19 and not to mention in college i was desperately looking for a job. of course i was looking around applying to several places until one day i had gotten an email from my professor saying she needed a pet sitter for her uncle from paris. i quickly thought oh wait, this is the perfect opportunity to get my money up...boy was i wrong. it was amazing how this person managed to use my professor’s email pretending to be her. so, apparently her uncle could only be contact through my personal email so i decided to shoot him an email right away to claim this job before any of my classmates had the chance. during these few days we were emailing back and forth about my duties and what he needed me to do. i didn’t think anything of it because when it comes to job and people relying on me i tend to get things done right away. this “person” instructed me saying that he needed someone to buy him groceries and other things for his apartment because he was from a different country and was moving to the us and later he updated me that he wouldn’t need me to do any of these things but take care of his english bulldog. but he did say to wire the money to a personal store manager once i have received the check and deduct my 300 for the week in advance and transfer the rest to the store manager. fast forward to yesterday, i had gotten  the check and it was a 4,850 dollar check. i was like woah....but i still didn’t think anything of it because what if he needed to buy other things other than groceries for his house? so he instructed me that i needed to deposit the check into the account and after doing so send the receipt of the deposit. and me being stupid, i did. i quickly came home and it wasn’t clicking until that this was a scam until i did my research and realized the person that is doing this was using the same exact format as other scams and me being paranoid i knew i fucked up. i called him out and asked him to describe what my professor looks like. if you were my professor’s uncle shouldn’t you know what your niece looks like? i haven’t heard from him since. i obviously didn’t send anyone the money and i was on phone calls with my friends about what the next step should be. my friend’s dad said to let it bounce and my bank will be coming after that money and after doing so i’m free to go? i contacted the corporate company of my bank to report the fraud and my local bank fraud and they said the same thing. putting notes in for me. i just feel really embarrassed and really stupid at this point. with this coronavirus going around also it just makes me feel even more upset. yes i know i should’ve used my brain more and looked for more signs but i was being naive. this will definitely be a learning lesson. 

i called my bank today and stated all of this. is there anything else i should do regarding this situation. let me know thanks!"

"is this job offer a scam? i received an offer for a position as a personal assistant. i was sent an employment from and i noticed this:

""according to how i have been briefed on the job duties and responsibilities, i will be prepaid in advance to do some shopping, bills payments, placing and expediting orders.  
sufficient funds will be issued out to me in form of a certified check for both transportation and other payments out of which i will deduct my weekly salary.""

does this mean that my pay will be included in the expense check, and that i can simply deduct the full amount? or does it mean that i will pay for the expenses with my weekly salary, and whatever is leftover is my pay?"

"fake dhl / atpost ""overweight surcharge"" scam i got an sms containing the following message:

verfolgen sie ihre sendung: [http://5pp.us/uqu2r](http://5pp.us/uqu2r)  
 note: do not visit unless you know what you're doing!  
this leads you to a page talking about a parcel being held somewhere in berlin and is asking you to pay an overweight surcharge of 2€. the only payment option is to pay by card, which is, imo, an immediate red flag.  
the domain is also suspicious: it is registered to an, obviously fake, address in wombwell, united states outlying islands. suffice to say, the address does exist, but it's located in barnsley, uk.  
another red flag is the missing ""about""  (""impressum"" in german) which is mandatory in all eu countries. neither dhl nor atpost would ever miss something so crucial for one of their websites.  


btw, i don't think that the tracking number is valid anyways. seems way too short.

what is the safest way to receive money from a stranger? this person is not near me so cash is not really an option. it's an intangible item (a blog) and i've heard of people losing money through venmo and paypal if a person disputes the charge with their bank. any advice on how to make this transaction safely?
"i believe a reddit user scammed me, what now? so a few days ago i found a post in r/vintage where a user was posting some stuff for sale and saying they were in need of an insulin pump. upon reviewing the posters other items i didn’t find anything i was that interested in, but repeatedly saw them commenting and posting about how they were in desperate need for an insulin pump. seeing how they had posted previously about needing money for insulin from about a month before and that they were an active member in a diabetics subreddit, i figured it was pretty legit.

so, i deposited some cash from my emergency fund and agreed to send them the 60$ they required for an insulin pump, in exchange they were to send me a picture of the pump and a receipt so i knew it hadn’t been used otherwise (i’ve had people screw me over for drug money irl before, never done anything like this on the internet). they wanted me to use google pay, but i only could use paypal with my payment method.

this is where things got kinda weird, they wanted me to use their friends paypal and leave a note but the name they wanted me to use didn’t match with any of the stuff they put on reddit. they also gave me an email to send the proof of payment to. this is after i sent the payment and i started to do a deeper dive on their reddit account, where i found some shady stuff with the vintage clothing they were supposedly selling and found out another redditor had purchased shoes that never arrived.

i gave it a few days and never heard from them so i decided to check, lo and behold the reddit account has been deleted. so, i tried to email the email they provided to me and that too has been deleted.

is there anything i can do about this? i’m unsure if the email associated with the paypal i sent payment through has been deleted or not, i haven’t tried emailing it but i wouldn’t be surprised. can/should i open a dispute with paypal? is there any way to get my money back?

it’s just not an insignificant amount of cash to me and i’d really prefer it went to someone actually in need rather than some scam artist, especially in this time of need."

"work-from-home scams amid covid-19 pandemic so i'm pretty embarrassed to admit that i was nearly scammed. nothing actually happened, but the scammer has some of my personal information such as my name, address, email address, date of birth and phone number. the reason she has all of this is that she claimed to be with the hr department of a reputable company and requested that i fill out an application form. coincidentally, i was in contact with a temp agency not too long before that and the person that i had spoken with told me she would over any postings, so stupid old me thought that it was something from her.  was a little wary from the get-go, but i tried to give the benefit of the doubt because the job was vetted from a reputable temp agency (or so i thought).

after i had gotten the ""job"", the scammer contacted me earlier today to try to have me transfer $2000 cad into bitcoin. she tried to get me to set up an automatic deposit for my bank account so she could send me over the money (she doesn't have my banking information - just my email). i immediately got a terrible gut feeling and stopped all contact with her. 

my question now is this: is there anything she can do going forward with my personal information? i do not want to be a victim of identity theft and i certainly do not want her trying anything sketchy with e-transfer. i feel like a gullible idiot, but i'm just glad i didn't actually do anything. any advice would be greatly appreciated. thank you guys."

we have two u.s phone numbers and we know the name of the owner of one of these, where could i report this? i went [here](https://www.uscis.gov/report-fraud) but i'm not sure if one of these options is right for this.

thank you in advance, i hope you're safe at home."
is tacowhip.com a scam website i’m building a home gym and found a workout bench on a website called tacowhip.com for a legitimate price but they offered 3-8 days shipping which is a tad faster than ebay or amazon. they also said they work around the clock 24/7 which is odd considering the whole quarantine and non essential business thing. anyone heard of or bought something from this website?

if you've gotten an email trying to scam you out of your hard-earned money via a coronavirus scam email can you please paste the entire email in this thread including any links included?  i'm trying to build out filters for my organizations spam protection and the more examples i can see the better as it will allow me to target numerous different attack patterns.  typically we see attackers shift their text continually to get past filters so i am typically having to put in a few dozen patterns for each common attack type.  so anything you have will be great.

scammers waste no time. there is already a scam for the stimulus checks with people getting calls asking for their bank information so the guvment can send you your $1200 check.  please pass on to any senior citizens you may know.

i'm a hacker who cracked your devices. i setup a malware on the adult video (porn) website and guess what, you visited this site to have fun (you know what i mean). while you were watching videos, your internet browser started out functioning as a ""hrdp"" - hidden remote desktop protocol having a keylogger which gave me accessibility to your screen and webcam. after that, my software program obtained all your contacts and files. you entered a password on the websites you visited, and i intercepted it. of course, you can change it, or already changed it. but it doesn't matter, my malware updated it every time.
 
what did i do?
i generated a backup of your every system (private document files, video, photos, all files).
i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were watching (you've got a good taste ha ha . . .), and 2nd part shows the recording of your webcam.
do not try to find and destroy my virus! (all your data is already uploaded to a remote server)
do not try to contact me. various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either, since your data is already on a remote server.
i guarantee you that i will not disturb you again after payment, as you are not my single victim. this is a hacker code of honor. don't be mad at me, everyone has their own work.
 
exactly what should you do?
well, in my opinion, $ 500 (usd) dollars is a fair price for our little secret. you'll make the payment by bitcoin (search ""bitcoin wallet"" in application store then download &amp; install) make a deposit to your wallet. after that, transfer it to my wallet.

sorry for the inconvenience. we would like to undertake the cost (£34.99) of your headphone to make up the unhappy experience. normally, you will receive the money within 2-3 business days. do you mind sending us your paypal account to process?

look forward to hearing from you. have a wonderful day!

best regards,
theirname""

their email has a word mispelt. like instead of customer its cutomer. but that might be just translation?

i replied saying that at the start of the year i tried using the item again and got them to work though part is still broken, she responded saying i still should have a refund, it can be in am amazon gift card or paypal.

i didnt respond and she sent this one today.

""hi myname,

this is theirname again. did you receive our last email?

i am willing to do anything i can to earn your 100% satisfaction. how about we arrange a itemmodel which is a classic model for you if you don't want to refund? you just need to send us your shipping address if you agree.

looking forward to your reply!

again, cant tell if it's just a customer rep looking through old reviews and trying to get the 1star reviews gone, or whether it's some sortve scam from someone who's really into it?

"scummy ""accidental"" zelle transfer scam? so back on thursday of last week, i got an email from my bank that i had received a $50 payment through zelle. it was addressed to someone with a similar first name, from somebody i don't know. i immediately suspected it to be a scam, wherein they ask me to send back the $50 myself and then reverse the original transaction. i cannot be 100% sure though because my email address is rather generic and tends to get the occasional accidental email.

i immediately called my bank to dispute the transaction, and it should be reviewed tomorrow.

just a few hours ago i got this email:

&gt; on 3/26/2020 i sent $50 to your account in error. i was trying to send the money to my daughter who has a similar email address as a donation to the doctors and nurses caring for patients with the coronavirus.   
&gt;  
&gt;please send back the $50 to my email &lt;email @ yahoo&gt;

that makes it really seem like a scam to me (and a scummy one at that). is there anything else i should do at this point? can they cause my account to be frozen? i'm thinking maybe i should set up a secondary checking account to link zelle to, to prevent any future zelle shenanigans."

"powerball help commission sigh.  so i got a message from a friend in canada asking me if i've ever heard of the powerball help commission.  he says ""they give away money to help poor people with bills, rent, etc.""  i said that it sure sounds like a scam to me.  he said ""it's not a scam. i got money. but think whatever you want.""

i responded to him to ask what ""money"" did he get ... a cheque?  from where?  how much?  cad or usd or other?  has he deposited it in a bank?  when?  has it cleared?  was he asked to send them any ""fees"" or ""taxes""?

he responded back to say he got cash.

really?  who gave you the cash?  when?  where did you meet them?

well, actually, he doesn't actually have the cash in hand ... they sent it, a ""carton of cash,"" by fedex.  he just has to contact the supervisor to pick it up because the guy couldn't deliver it to the apartment.

i said, that's very odd ... for a number of reasons ... including that it is explicitly against fedex terms of services to use their service to send cash.  i would find it very strange that a legitimate business/charity would be paying cash, period, but that they would knowingly (and a legit charity/business would know) violating fedex rules in order to do so.  further, if it's coming from the u.s. (or elsewhere) to canada it will surely be stopped at customs who will be very curious as to what's up with a ""carton of cash.""

nope, not a problem apparently, ""they already said they've sent a form for customs.""

i told him that i suspect when he calls the supposed fedex supervisor to make arrangements to collect this carton of cash that he'll be asked to first pay (by westernunion, interac etransfer, bitcoin machine/gift cards, or other) some fees or taxes or processing charges ... and then they will let him know where to come and get his carton of money ... and once they have his legit money that he send them suddenly there will be no carton of cash waiting, and they won't answer your calls/emails any more.  but ... if you receive a carton of cash, and don't have to pay anything to get it, i'll be very interested to have a look at it ... so let me know if you get it.

and if he does get a carton of cash my next thought is ... is it real or counterfeit and will the canadian-based members of a gang be showing up to collect it."

"netflix account hacked. beware of unusual login prompts when watching. i have a netflix subscription that allows multiple people to watch simultaneously. so i've shared my login details with my sister who studies in germany (i stay in the us). she frequently uses my netflix account.

a few days ago, i woke up to an email from netflix stating that my email address associated with my account was changed, and there was login from algeria. voila! the account was hacked. i couldn't even do anything apart from calling netflix and explaining my situation. fortunately, i was able to change my login email, and i got back my account.

i mentioned this to my sister. she said that she had googled something along the lines of 'best shows on netflix'. the resulting search took her to a website (which she can't remember now) which had the shows. at the bottom of the list, there was a link which said 'take me to netflix now'. my sister, as pretty much expected, clicked on it and it led to netflix.

while she was watching, she got multiple prompts to login to netflix, even though she was already watching a show. again, good lord, she 'logged' in. this happened on 3 different days. it lead to my account being hacked.

tl;dr - never click on links that say 'take me to abc now', and no legit service will ask you to login again and again while you're using the service."
"what is the scam here? or does everyone really fat finger my email instead of theirs? i’ve had my gmail accounts since back in the beta test/invite only days, so they are “prime” addresses - fairly short, without numbers, etc.

obviously, i never click on the links and they go in the trash, but occasionally i’ll directly visit the site and confirm that there’s an account with this email address. 

is there some kind of game afoot, or do all these people just foul up entering their email?"

"company contacts me to do freelance work, i don’t know if this is just a complicated scam. a few weeks ago, i had a company contact me about doing some freelance work for them. i work in education and they contacted me through my work email. i have not advertised my services anywhere so i was a bit skeptical. the email itself looked legitimate, no spelling errors, gave company address, phone number, and website, and the email address was something along the lines of smithj@company.org. i went to their website and it’s definitely legitimate. i was able to find and confirm the email address of the person that contacted me. i replied to the email and participated in a phone interview and they offered me the freelance work and i accepted. since then, that have emailed me copies of the materials they would like reviewed and they’ve been able to answer any of my technical questions. 

why i’m concerned if this is a well thought out scam is because this past week they asked for several things from me. a price quote, w-9, and other identifying information. i know these documents are required for business and tax purposes, but i’m still worried about giving out this much info. has anyone encountered a scam that sounds like this? are there any ways for me to protect myself? would it be tacky or unprofessional to ask how they got my information? any advice is helpful, thank you!"
"calling back a spoofed number? so, my mom recently received what i suspect to be a spoofed phone call from our local bank. she called back after having received a voicemail, and when they were unable to verify her account they proceeded to take her social security number, date of birth, and other information. she felt uncomfortable and hung up and told me what had happened.

i'm not too familiar with how spoofing works, but from my understanding, the only risk would be if she had actually answered the initial call, not if she initiated the phone call. could her calling back that potentially spoofed number (which is legitimately the bank's phone number) result in her calling back the scammer? she just tapped on the recent's number from her iphone.

sorry if i'm a bit unclear - still a bit shaken by the whole thing and wondering if i need to have her report identity theft."

they've got a couple of angles with this scam 
"so i found a scammers house... it all started when i got a dm on instagram from an account with no photos at all. 

the message was “i like sex, and you?”

clearly a scam.

it was a group chat including tons of people i don’t know. (not the first time i got a message like this)

but this time, i noticed something different..

the account with not a single photo posted has 1 follower.

i assume he followed the fake account he made in hopes of improving its credibility.

it immediately became obvious it was him after learning he was based out of palakkad, india. 

he also looked exactly like the kind of indian asshole who would try something like this. there’s a photo of him sitting on a motorbike with sunglasses (probably thinks he looks super cool). but clearly he isn’t smart about it, because he had photos posted of him and his kid with the location posted. it led directly to the guys house.

i also messaged him on his original account calling him out and his response was to block me because clearly, he is guilty. i messaged him on a second account sending him a screenshot of his location, and he blocked me again. no response. clearly i got him scared.

i really didn’t expect it to be this easy to locate a scammer so accurately. i told him i sent his info to the fbi to spook him. lol what do you guys recommend i do with this information?"

"help needed in order to make seller to refund me in failed purchase hello everyone,

i have met a guy on reddit almost 4 months ago. he was selling listings of his phone case etsy shop and posted his sales and it seemed profitable business and only thing was to do is upload images and list them on etsy and as soon as order comes it is needed to send the image to print on demand company and they ship to phone case to customers. 

i talked to this guy and even video called couple times he seemed a nice person and he told his listing images are unique and he will sell them only one person. and i trusted him and sent him $2000 via transferwise. as soon as he got the money he didn't respond to my messages and calls but he was active on reddit and commenting people that he hasn't found a buyer yet. he finally responded to me a day later that he was at the party and he is on vacation mode bla bla... it took him 3 days to send the listings. he also sent 75% of the number of listings that he promised.

i have another reddit account. i sent him message pretending to be a potential buyer and he said he hasn't found any buyer yet. i don't know how many times this guy sold the same listings over and over again by claiming they are unique. i told him to send my money back he said he will refund it but it has been over 3 months and i have never received the money yet. he stopped responding to me 2 months ago. i know he does see my messages because i contacted him from my second reddit account and i acted like i am a potential buyer and he sent me a message.

from my second account, i am planning to tell him that i know you had failed purchase by a different guy and you didn't send his money back. as soon as you refund his money i will buy your listings. he first told it was $2500 to my second account. but now he tells it's $2000. i am planning to tell him i will send you $2500 if you refund this guy's money.

i also found his facebook account and plan to contact anyone who has his last name on his friends' list and explain the situation and tell them to please tell him to refund my money. i hope his parents will respond to me and make him refund

i want to make this guy send my money back but i don't know how? can anyone help me? he lives in canada and i live in turkey. if i contact canadian police does it help?

has anyone of you been in a similar situation? how can i get my money back? any brilliant ideas?"

"someone called and asked for my phone number. was this a scam? so, about a year ago, i had a random phone number call me. i don’t remember why i answered an unknown number as i typically ignore them. when i answered the phone, a random person asked for someone and i replied that it wasn’t me, he had the wrong phone number. he proceeded to ask me what my phone number was to which i replied that i wasn’t going to tell him my number. he kept persisting for me to tell him, so i told him that he called me and if he wanted my phone number that badly than he can just look at his caller id. 

for the past year, i haven’t been able to figure out if i was rude to a random person or if i was right to refuse to say my phone number. i remember reading somewhere that scammers will record you saying numbers and affirmative responses for some reason. i could be totally wrong about that, i’m not sure. 

tl;dr a random person called me and asked me to tell them my phone number. i refused but i’m still not sure if i was just rude or if they were actually a scammer."

"i have officially been scammed and bought fake shoes but i think i can get out of it with a little help from some people who know the law better than i do. so to start off i bought these shoes from a website that sells **fake** shoes: [cozxs.com](https://cozxs.com) and i received the product 25 days after ordering it and i knew immediately that they were fake and tried to return them. what a surprise the customer management phone numbers and emails were fake and they were the only way you could ""get in touch"" and make a return.

 however since i payed through paypal the payment was cancelled after 30 days because the seller didn't claim the payment. the seller is know asking me to redo the payment but since the seller doesn't have a proper business paypal account he is simply using his email i don't think that  i legally need to pay him since he didn't claim the first time. i might try to negotiate a return over paypal but the websites policy says you can't return after 30 days after the payment, today is the 30th day after the payment so i could try to negotiate a return but i feel that will get me nowhere, i am very tempted to ignore his email and maybe post the product back to the seller. would this be ok? are there any legal ways that i could get my money back and out scam the scammer? i am not one to know about the law very well so i am seeking advice where ever i can get it.

one more thing, i do not think i can say that it is not the product i asked for or a scam etc. because the seller put every description of the nike product that i bought but didn't put the name nike in it so they can technically claim it as ""their original product""!!!!!!!"

"i feel my parents are getting ripped off on a kitchen repair job...any advice? so long story short my parents found water coming up under the floor in their kitchen. they discovered that the water line running to the coffee maker had like a pin tip hole in it and had been leaking/spraying water behind the dishwasher for a while...dry wall all rotted and moldy.

so basically insurance agrees to repair it and thus this now month long endeavor that's not even done yet begins. naturally my mom asked if she could upgrade anything in the repair/replace process...insurance said ""sure, if you wanna pay for it elsewise we're just under obligation to repair things to exactly how they were"". alright, kinda sucks but fair enough, right? they're there to repair, not replace.

well so far:

* the wooden subfloor under the dishwasher is all warped from water damage...they didn't replace this, why? who knows.

* parents were charged $5,000 for ""rebuilt cabinets"" in which all they did was rip out the old ones, replaced a few pieces of the wood that had mold and repainted them and reinstalled. didn't even replace the old worn down rollers, knobs, hinges, nothing. exact same cabinets plus new cheap ass paint and a few pieces of compressed wooden board. this costs $5,251 some how. 

* counter tops originally were just that sort of laminate but they were nice and had seemless beveled edges/rear border and a nice texture to them. new counter tops are literally the cheapest thing ever. all the edges are square with flat cut smooth cheap as shit feeling laminate. now where near ""exactly how they were"". to me seamless edges is a feature, not a preference.

* the house has hard flooring flowing seamlessly through the whole house. the lock together nice plastic stuff - even the people tearing it up mentioned how nice it was. now this is something they paid good money for and a major selling point to a house. insurance wants to put threshholds everywhere and just redo the kitchen. again, how is this ""exactly how it was""?

like, these people aren't a goddamn charity...my folks pay to have insurance...i could understand the cut corners if it was like a church repairing it for free because they couldn't afford it and shit...that's fine...but they're paying money for this and i don't think it's right that all these obvious cheap ass corners are being cut if not problems being outright ignored. 

oh wait, they are doing us one favor...they charishably agreed to repaint the top cabinets to match the new colored bottom ones...but ya know...only the outside. inside we'd have to pay for. 

any ways if anyone has words of wisdom, good or bad, i'd appreciate it! thanks!"

"paypal opened with my email address got a few emails at once from paypal, notifying me of a new account opened, then a phone number added, then a bank added, then money transferred to me, then money sent. the next few emails prompted me to verify my email address.

i read them all but logged into paypal by going directly to the site....and everything was untouched. after some googling, i found out paypal won’t let you open multiple accounts with one email, so i figured out it was fake. 

is this a common scam? i knew enough to self-navigate to paypal to log in. i’m guessing the scammers were hoping i’d click on any of the “if you didn’t do this, click here to change your pw” etc emails. but i will admit the urgency was more bc it felt like someone was currently logged in and active, and that’s what almost got me to panic and do something stupid. the emails themselves were professionally spoofed too."

"fraud alert: usda warns of scams targeting snap recipients (copied text from article, at usda.gov website)

&gt;contact

fns communications: fnspress@usda.gov

washington, march 24, 2020 – be on the lookout for potential scammers using the covid-19 situation to steal personal information, the u.s. department of agriculture (usda) warned supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap) participants today. usda is issuing this warning after receiving reports of several possible snap fraud attempts.

“while many organizations are seeking to help communities respond to covid-19, snap participants should be suspicious of any unknown individual or organization that requests their confidential information,” said brandon lipps, deputy under secretary for usda’s food, nutrition, and consumer services, which administers the snap program at the federal level. “this is a difficult time for us all, and we certainly don't want to see bad actors taking advantage of those in need.”

examples of confidential information include social security number, bank information, or a participant’s snap ebt card or pin number. in one potential scam, a website asked snap recipients to enter their personal and bank account information to qualify for covid-related monetary assistance.

if snap participants are unsure if a request for information is legitimate, usda advises they contact their local snap office.  if they do not know their local snap office, participants should contact their state agency. state contact information is available at https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory.

to stay on top of potential scams, please visit usda’s snap scam alert webpage at https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/scam-alerts.

if you believe you are the victim of identity theft, contact your local police department regarding procedures for filing a report.  you may also file a consumer complaint online with the federal trade commission (ftc) at https://www.ftc.gov.  ftc is the federal agency responsible for protecting consumers from identity theft scams."

"your child (me) needs money so it was a few months back, but my parents got a whatsapp from an unknown phone number. it said that i had to pay for the heating system since it was broken and i was texting with a different phone, because i had lost mine. now i am a little forgetfull, and it happened in the past, but both my mom and dad saw trough this scam immediately. it wasn't that hard either since my mom figured out it couldn't be me, since they used poor spelling and grammar in my native language. (thanks mom) and my dad's first thought was: but she hates smartphones, she uses a nokia.

so ,y parents decided to play along. my dad hates scammers and because he is 100% lawfull good, he always has a full legal team that he can call whenever. my parents first questioned them about why they would need to pay for that since i am renting. they made a whole lot excuses and the conversation didn't really go anywhere. o they asked for details, like their bank number (probably not theirs, but atleast the police would get involved before a crime was going to happen.) when they had all the details, my dad just texted: (translation) good luck you fucking dirty scammer. and that was the end of it. my parents said they got blocked pretty fast, but the whole situation was funny nonetheless."

"how do job scams work? i was offered a job and it seems too good to be true and i’m curious on if/how its a scam.

to start, i don’t remember putting an application in for this job but i have been using indeed, ziprecruiter etc and applied to 10+ jobs. i tried looking for a confirmation email for this company/position and couldn’t find it. they (hr) called me and offered me an interview. she said they had my resume and confirmed the email on my resume and said they would email me some information about the company and position. it got sent to my other email that i use for ziprecruiter, not the one on my resume. another sketchy thing to mention is the email was “companynamehr@gmail.com” which i think is sketchy because buying a domain is sooo cheap, especially if you’re company is as successful as they’ve been saying. i think it should be more like “hr@companyname.com”

i did some basic research of the company as i do with any job. their website is extremely vague but has a faq in which they state their intentionally vague because they work with fortune 500 companies and need to protect privacy etc. the website seemed like it was made for only potential employees to see, not clients. i can find a lot of information on their supposed hq in another state, but nothing on the company in my state. no reviews or anything.

they set me up to do a virtual interview through zoom. interview went well. the guy mentioned they were interviewing 60+ people for the position. it was a sales position and within a year the expectation of being promoted to director of operations. i have customer service and sales experience but i’m young and i never went to college so my hopes weren’t very high that i’d be the best candidate over 60+ other people. 

the guy who interviewed me (called himself the co) called me the next day. not even 12 hours after my interview and offered me the job, dependent on when my state lifts all the current “lock down” measures. i pretty much told him i would think about it. he called from a different number thats listed on their website (which is the one hr called from) that showed up as town over 6 hours away. google didn’t help much with information on either phone number. 

so, could this be a scam? if so, what are they hoping to get out of it? i haven’t given them any personal information outside of my resume, the webcam app thing they used didn’t ask for any type of consent to authorize them to use it and as far as i can tell its not running in the background on my laptop.. i’m just super confused and hoping someone here can help!"
"companies using tik tok to scam kids? i'm sure we have all seen those scams on youtube that promise things like ""tik tok followers"" or ""instagram followers"" but really just take you to some human verification website where you have to download three apps and use them for at least 30 seconds. 

this entire industry sounds like a click farm rig to me. but i have so many questions. questions like ""how are they making money?"" ""who's behind all of this?"" and ""why those apps in particular?""

at first i just assumed it was simple affiliate link abusers. however, after doing more investigations, i now believe that billion dollar corporations are really the ones behind all of it. they are responsible for

i woke up toady at 12:00am (normal quarantine waking up time) and tried calling my girlfriend. my gf ended my call right away, right after the dial rang. she normally does this when she is calling one of her friends or family so i gave her about 10-20 minutes to finish talking ( she usually finishes her call in 10min., max.). 30 minutes later she wasen\`t getting my calls so i was getting worried. i texted her to check if everything was fine. it took a while for her to check my text, and when she did she had very long brakes between her texts. she normally would not do that so i sensed something was wrong. so i called her multiple times but she still wasen\`t getting my call. forward to 20 minutes later she calls me saying (she was literally crying at this point)

someone from the govv has found her credit card somewhere and they are concerned that its been hacked and they want to make sure that it is hers. they also told her to send a screenshot of her bank account. she also told me that they told her to update them on whatsapp every hour. 

she was really scared so i tried my best to calm her down and i sent her to the bank to talk to the managers because i know that they are used to this kind of bs and can take care of it better than me. unfortunately, the bank was closed and all she could do was to take out all of her money from the atm. she needs the card so she couldn\`t freeze it. 

it was really fucking scary to see how a person so close could get scammed. it is so scary that all of our privacy is gone these days, phones have mics and cams on 247 access to all of image database. scary."
"can someone scam with cash deposits? i live outside of the us but i have an aunt there. recently i sold my pc for 800$ and the guy told me that he was going to deposit the amount to my aunts chase account. he took a very long time and yesterday messaged me saying that he deposited the 800$ and sent me a photo, i called my aunt and she told me that a much larger amount appeared on her account, not the 800$. the guy told me that he made a mistake and sent me the large amount and my 800$ to another persons account and he wanted back the difference. i was wondering if this could be a scam, can someone cancel or reverse an deposit?

i have personally had salesmen try to screw me with warranties and on my trade-in, but i've never heard of this next level bullshit. the silver tongued parasitewalked walked up to a customer papers waiting to be signed that included things that hadn't been discussed, adding 45% to the total cost! and refused to sell the car for fair market value... ¿¡which was the advertised price!? does this kinda shit actually happen? how is it acceptable?

"cjs cd keys scam (selling computer download codes) i’m a uk customer 2 days ago i bought a 12 month playstation plus subscription from cjs cd keys.

i used the code and it didn’t work

i emailed them stating the code was invalid. 

they emailed me back asking me to jump through multiple hoops before they would even consider looking at it. 

after about 10 emails back and forward (you can tell when a company is trying to grind you into submission so you give up) i eventually ticked all there boxes doing loads of screenshots.

eventually they responded with the below text i was speechless as i’m sure you will be. 

‘’the code you purchased was for italy. 

i will offer the code for resale. when resold we will refund you.  allow as long as possible and then contact us again to check the status”

so basically they are saying they are keeping my money and won’t refund it until they have resold this code elsewhere.

clearly just another delay tactic for a dodgy company that is out to scam people. 

please please do not use this company. there is too much going on in the world right now with coronavirus to be dealing with such a low life company who are out to steal your hard earned money.

"scam or stupid person? i'm just wondering if this is an attempted scam or if i was just dealing with a stupid person.

i had a chromebook sitting around the house. i used it in university but have since graduated and have a new laptop. because i've been sent home for now and am not being paid, i needed some cash. i decided to sell it on fb marketplace, and a man responded right away. he said he would be coming over later that day to get it. 

i left it on the hood of my car and told him to turn on the laptop to ensure it worked, and log into his own google account. i had done a factory reset the previous day and it was fully charged. he insisted it was fine, left the money, and then was gone. 

i recieved a message from him hours later. he said the laptop wasn't working and could i call him. i did call him, he said he needed to log into my google account to reset the laptop. i told him no and that the laptop was already reset. he said he would send me a video. the video he sent did say ""you are not authorized to use this device"", but i had never seen that message before. i sent him a link to a troubleshooting site. he called me 3 different times, each time insisting i give him my google account and password, then change my password. i told him no each time and said i have personal information on my account. in the second call, i was fed up and just said return the laptop then and i will give you the money back. he said he had traveled from a big city 2 hours away to buy the laptop and wasn't traveling back, then asked for my password again. 

when it became obvious i was never handing over my password, he magically found a solution and i havent heard back from him.

i'm really confused about whether he was trying to take over my account (which does have my credit card attached to it, though i never told him that), or if he was just really stupid. i have never heard of anything like this happening"

i know this was stupid, i can't explain to you how stupid i feel right now. i was in a work mindset and getting an urgent request from somebody that high up i just went and did it.

chase has told me to dispute it when teh transaction posts, and that they've had a dozen calls today with similar situations. she said it shouldn't be an issue to dispute. i'm also trying to contact kroger right now to see if they can cancel the transaction on their end.

am i fucked? i'm in a mental state right now that is almost physical pain thinking about my foolishness. i should have known.

i pressed 3 to talk to a person and they brusquely asked how much my student loan payments are costing me. i said $2,200, at which point the woman on the phone quickly and rudely responded ""that's too much you don't qualify"" followed by her immediately hanging up.

so i called back 3 more times from 3 more phone numbers. same person answered the call each time and one of the times i heard ""we keep getting all these bullshit calls"" from her before she spoke into the phone.

the last time i called, when she picked up i just said ""so what kind of scam are you running here, exactly?"" to which she said ""you're just an idiot telling me you have $2,200 per month payments"" and then hung up again.

"(apperent) netflix mail in arabic i get occanisonally e-mails that appear to be from netflix (also the sending e-mail address looks legit - i know it could be spoofed) that appears to be in netflix. the weird thing is that they are written in arabic. i do not speak arabic nor do i have any connections to that language or region. the links appear to only go to the netflix page. the google translate looks like some sort of advert to join netflix. the e-mail address is a variation of the one i actually use - same mailbox but with different endings, googlemail.com vs gmail.com.

i thought it might be somebody trying to steal my account or something, but as far as i can tell there have been no login attempts from arabian countries. i also changed my password already. any ideas?

"possible job posting scam i've been going through various sites and apps responding to job offers. earlier this week, i got an email to the effect of, ""unfortunately, the job you applied for isn't available anymore, but we've got something else instead!"" the original ad (from what i can remember, as there have been a lot), was a warehouse position. this new one is a part time work from home position posting want ads on a different job site. oh, and since this is an online job, there's not even an interview to go to

a follow-up email said, basically, that they would give me a yahoo email address to create, and then send the info for the job posting to it. every new post, a new email address. they then asked how i'd like to be paid, and even offered e-transfer (most scams i've run across want some other convoluted way of paying, for obvious reasons)

i did a quick google search of the business the emails said they were from. it's a real local investment company. nothing showed up for the name the emailer used. doesn't mean much, but there's that. one strange thing is that, though every email stresses that they want to get started asap, they only respond once per day, at like 5pm local time

[it was all whatever until this latest email, where they suddenly remembered that posting ads requires a credit card, and now they want to do some something with a prepaid card](https://i.imgur.com/hhsuvvx.png)

i have to wait another day for their next response. in the meantime, what's up with this?"

"my independent, sports car driving, sharp as a tack grandmother got a call from “me” today so. my dearly loved grandmother (who has always been called “grammie” starting with me, her oldest grandchild) got a phone call today.

apparently i was in miami and got into a car wreck that resulted in a physical altercation with a cia (!?!) agent. the issue is, i was about 1k miles away from miami taking my two 🐀 boys to the vet. 

her grammie instinct kicked in big time. she immediately went to our family financial advisor to cash out a huge amount of money to transfer to their bank account.

thankfully, said advisor has known my family for nearly 30 years. he knew me growing up. red flags went up like crazy and he called my father. yes, perhaps a bit unethical as it is her money to do with as she pleases but it would’ve been far less ethical to allow a scam.

thank fuck it was stopped. the person on the other end of the phone apparently sounded like me and was “crying” and whatever. but then (later) grammie realized her phrasing was off (i usually live in the u.k. and i do have a slight accent and phrase things differently than what is typical in the us)... and the bitch called her “grandma”. 

the “lawyer” called my grammie back later in the afternoon asking about the money. she told him to go fuck himself and put the phone down. (shes a badass.)

it’s floored me that my grammie would pay that kind of money without a second thought if i was in trouble. i struggle with feeling loved... and it really hit me. i had to pull over from crying so hard.

now, for the question - what can be done? will anyone actually follow up? are there any good and easy to understand resources for people of advanced ages about these scams so they are prepared if they get the same phone call? 

and... is it possible for an individual to find them? jus o chat..."

maybe nothing bad wont happend and i am overthinking but how to protect from this kind of situations?

if i will record on video at post office how i pack it, the condition, etc will it help from potential scammers?"

i’ve checked all my cards and bank accounts, and there haven’t been any unauthorized attempts or purchases made on them. i checked my credit score and there also hasn’t been any new accounts opened under my name/ssn.

any advice for what i should do?"

i havent been able to get in contact with verizon but i did deactive my voicemail online, not sure if this is a solution to not being completely embarrased after missing a call from a friend or family."

"sugar daddy scam caught i just wanna thank this sub for giving me some techniques to figure out if someone's trying to scam me. 

i was in a public forum and some guy dropped his phone number and name saying he wanted to spoil someone and for a girl to become his sugar baby. my friends told me to just shoot him a message using an app and see if he was serious or some weirdo/scammer. 

i contacted him and his english was really good, he told me his first and last name and he sent me pictures. i did not send my pictures but he seemed to not care and asked me to be his sugar baby. i was curious to see if he was legitimate or not so i took him up on it. 

initially, i completely believed he was a scammer because it just didn't make sense but after 48hrs or so and him sending me pictures of himself (not attractive at all), i started thinking maybe he could the the real deal. 

he told me he lived in colorado and was in marketing, graduated from the air force academy and had gotten out. i sent him a link to an article and used grabify to figure out his ip address because he was asking for my information so he could put me on his payroll for my allowance. he clicked on the link and i saw that he was using either a vpn or a proxy and that thing was set in atlanta ga. after talking to him on the phone, i couldn't figure out whether it was a nigerian or latin american accent but i realized grabify helped me. 

i just wanna say thank you to this subreddit for always figuring out unconventional ways to verify people"
"south carolina coronavirus ""housecleaners"" scam attempt so late afternoon today, a lady knocked on my door (odd knock). i had never seen her before and was parked on the road in front of the house. three other people were visible in the suv (appeared to all be male). she started off by trying to hand off a container of cleaning product, claimed she was licensed by the cdc to sanitize houses in light of the virus. before there could be a response she tried to go back to the vehicle to ""get more supplies"" at which point she was told to leave with her crap and a police report was filed.

this lady and her friends might have just been out to make a little side money during the crisis but the cdc licensing anyone to do any sanitizing this soon out of the back of an suv can't be right."

drop ship spammer x post from r/gybe not sure exactly the reach of r/gybe or the identified user but figured it worth posting here that [u/square\_future](https://www.reddit.com/u/square_future/) has been identified as a drop ship scammer.   the consensus was that if anyone had purchased anything from the spammers link that they ought to consider their cc info to be lost/stolen.  figure'd that i'd post it here anyways in the event that anyone else came across the individual.  cheers all.

"wondering how to stop a scammer from taking advantage of a friend with autism i'll briefly describe my friend and his current situation. he in his early 40s who has autism. he lives in an assisted living facility and is on a fixed income from social security i believe.  his parents are his legal guardians so they are supposed to be in charge of his finances and any bank account he might open and they receive his social security checks and then pay the assisted living facility for him to live there. he was a pretty well known local artist in our downtown area but kind of disappeared a few years ago.

i recently reconnected with him and he told me i hadn't seen him much because he never had any money to get a bus pass or money to spend downtown anyway. initially i thought maybe his parents were keeping a majority of his social security check and letting him live in a dumpy assisted living facility. i offered to help him get some of his art in art galleries so he could get some more income for art supplies since to keep making art.

i started getting him money and buying more art supplies. he then started asking me if i would buy steam, amazon, and ebay gift cards with most of the money so he could send them to his girlfriend. i've was about 90% certain he was getting scammed by someone from the beginning.  after a couple of times i told him i didn't want to buy him anymore gift cards because i thought the person was scamming him. he assured me it wasn't a scam because he had been scammed by someone before who requested gift cards so he was able to tell this person wasn't scamming him. i was now 100% sure he was getting scammed and it was most likely the same person or group of people before. i stopped buying him the gift cards but assumed he was walking to the nearest place he could and was buying them anyway.

since covid19 quarantine he hasn't been allowed to freely leave his facility each day since most of the residents are 80+. he has started asking me again if i'd use all the money i recently gave him to go buy gift cards and bring them to him. he said his girlfriend needed them and was angry and he has become despondent and depressed because of it.

i don't have any contact info for his parents but might be able to get their information from the assisted living facility. i could go buy the gift cards and keep all the information about them if that could somehow be used to track information about the people using them.

i am looking for a way to get information about the person or people requesting gift cards, any info on reporting the scammers, any other advice people might have who might have had similar experiences."

as a horny idiot, i say yes of course. we get on hangout, and she says she wants to video and show me all of her and me show all of her.

she video me, and she starts to take of clothes, and then i film my junk and start showing it off.

suddenly it stops and theres a video of my face, and my junk.  
she now wants money from me, or shes gonna post it. 

i am thinking - who is gonna want to see this bad porn anyways? but she threatens to ruin my life? i was logged into a fake google account, with fake name, no phone number or anyone.  
can they really ruin my life now like they say?

i have family, friends and girlfriend i dont want to know about how incredibly stupid i am.

do any of you have any experience with this?"
"alert cryptocurrency scammer with fake broker and account management in recent 2019 until now, there is a scammer using \*\*fake broker\*\* names: \*\*digitaltradefx\*\* “[http://www.digitaltradefx.com](http://www.digitaltradefx.com/)"", “\*\*digitaltradefirm\*\* ”[http://www.digitaltradefirm.com](http://www.digitaltradefirm.com/)“, \*\*traceoptionfx\*\* “[http://www.traceoptionfx.com](http://www.traceoptionfx.com/)"" or “\*\*cryptonlinefxpro\*\* ”[http://www.cryptolinefxpro.com](http://www.cryptolinefxpro.com/)"" , he is contacting people directly through instagram, facebook, twitter, telegram, whatsapp and using different \*\*fake profile\*\*  …. claiming himself as an account manager. he is using a different \*\*fake phone number\*\*, and many others. last year he was using &lt;&lt;digitaltradefirm&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; to scam people and then he changes it this year. the website looks familiar with\*\* pocket option\*\* web (another fraud broker in eu) .

&amp;#x200b;

he promised a high return on investment weekly, to his victim investors. once you put your money in his hands, you will never get anything back from him as money. first, let's start with the website. the website phone number belong to two different platforms…be aware of that. the support team contact will never help get your money back….he is behind all that and using a fake certificate.

when you try to reach the support team by the web, there is another contacts email appear with another fake web he is using. he may allow you to\*\* become affiliate \*\*to him, introduce his platform to others and bring more victim in his game…. \*\*don’t put your friends hard earn money in his hands.\*\*. now, in the platform itself, there only one way…deposit your money. all withdraw possibility are fake, and it will never work. the platform itself looks like pocket option platform.

on the platform, you make deposit by bitcoin address he provides you. you money grow week after week. then the withdraw, this is where the game change. \*\*you can never withdraw\*\* by crypto address, paypal or skrill. he will send you to a \*\*fake bank\*\* he names\*\* rocunity bank\*\* “[http://www.rocunity.com](http://www.rocunity.com/)“   which is a \*\*fake website\*\* he creates less than a month ago\*\*. the website is empty, you won’t get any information in there. your money is gone.

a website he bought about another bank…. look down of the page. he said the bank was create since 1865 but he just create the website less than a month ago. the grammar on the web page is wrong. he download some images on google containing another language to feed the web. \*\*if he contact you about investment or borrow money with him, you report and ignore it.\*\*

after try many time to get your deposit back, he will ignore you or try to put you in another scam business. he has many accounts on facebook, instagram, twitter, whatsapp, telegram …etc. he may work from india or us between those places despite his fake ip address he used. he create many group on telegram for investment in short term, if he get in touch with you…. know you are not in good hands. remember and share the message with your friends.. now you know how the scammer work and if you want to invest in crypto or forex, you better find a regulated broker and well known. see you!"

"craigslist collectible scam hi all,

looking for some help or suggestions here. i collect high end collectible trading cards. about 3 weeks a local craigslist ad appeared on craigslist for sealed card packs that i reached out to. i had spoke with the seller very frequently for the past few weeks, often talking on the phone to set up a place to meet to buy these cards. we had set a time and place me for to meet his girlfriend as he said he was in mexico during that time and being quarantined. i met with her.. inspected the items and handed over the cash. it turns out the items were fake.. i reached out to the seller and he initially seemed surprised and promised to set a time and place to return my money.. he has since disappeared. 

it also turns out all the numbers i’ve been communicating with him and his female accomplice were burner phones and have since been deactivated. now the seller has still been speaking with other people through the craigslist masked email from the ad, but the ad has been taken down. i’ve filed a police report and they are currently reviewing cctv footage of the exchange. they are perusing charges of fraud over $5000. i’ve also requested info from craigslist but they have not responded. is there anything else i can do to find this person? i do still have all the information from the original posting. any help is much appreciated. the whole situation has me disgusted and i just want to get some justice on all of this. thanks for any advice at all!"

"i got scammed $250,000aud as a 24yo from a cryptocurrency platform, help! i cannot believe i am even writing this right now or that i'd be a victim to one of these scams. i'm a fellow 24 yo australian redditor.

i met a dude on a dating app and was encouraged to open up an account on b i n a n c e b b  t dot com (just typing it like that just incase they find my post...). i ended up continuously depositing money into it to trade cryptocurrency. i have lost a total of $250000aud to this scam.

started from small sums like $500 under the encouragement of my online 'friend' and ended up depositing larger sums like $20000 to trade on the platform. he was teaching me how to earn money on the platform, and i was 'earning' a lot, he was also lovely to talk to. 

eventually, my account was frozen because i had broken some sort of platform rule and i had to chuck in $40000usd to unfreeze the account (because if you don't unfreeze it you lose all the money in the account apparently). i did that and then they came up with another condition so i chucked in another $30000usd, but it wasn't enough so they asked for another $50000usd. that's when stupid me realised it was a scam.

it seems so obvious that it's a scam, but the reason i fell for this is stupidity plus my trust in this guy who was friends with me for 3-4 months and would text me everyday to teach me about trading and help me with other things as well. he said the platform was secure so obviously the platform must be secure. i was also able to withdraw from the platform once around $30000aud but i think that was because i told my online friend in advance who probably notified the platform.

anyway, 85% of this cash is part of my parents retirement funds. words cannot express how terrible this situation is. i squandered my parents retirement cash, they are getting old, i'm heart broken my conversations with this guy are all based on falsehood and lies, now this covid situation, and my dream of leaving my current job and travelling overseas for an extended period of time and many more small freedoms afforded by this lump sum which i've lost are all gone. i will have to pay back my parents weekly (of course). my home loan also has gone from 13 years back to 30 years. wow... i guess this is the price i have to pay for idiocracy. no words can describe how i feel..

what should i do now? i'm in australia. i've reported to acorn and sent a brief message to scamnewschannel... not sure when they'll get back. can i possibly get my funds back? will there be justice? can i find this guy... he has photos and a name but who knows if it's real. i've also been talking to this guy in chinese so this is a chinese scam artist. does anyone have any advice, any advice is welcome."

"scam or just my bad memory? my recent experience just freaked me out so much and i am so confused at what happened.

tldr: a girl called saying she is someone who i met a while ago at a party (she knew the name of a persons house i hung out at like half a year ago). she said she went to the same school as me, and knew that i wrestled. she claimed she wrestled too, and that she challenged me to a match at this party. i have absolutely no recollection of this event at all, and i knew nobody with her supposed name (kaitlin). ive heard of scams where people try to get you to say things like ""yes"" or ""ok"" and use the recordings, and i was wondering if this was that.

longer story: i got a phone call from and unknown number. i remained completely silent, and the voice said ""hello"" after a short pause. i stayed silent. she said a few more things to try to get me to talk, but i hung up. the same number then calls me 10 seconds later. she say ""hello"" and i say ""who is this?"" they say ""its kaitlin"" and i respond asking who that is. her voice was really eager and energetic, and i swear i hear someones voice in the background for a second or two, but never again. she said ""hey im a wrestler, and want to know if choking somebody is illegal"" (i forget exactly what she said but it had to do with confirming whether or not a move is legal). i responded asking how she knew i wrestled, and asked what school she went to (probably should have hung up before this). she named my school, and said she met me at a friends house (she named the friend, which is why i think this is more of my bad memory than a scam). but, i had not been to this persons house for about half a year, and have since broken off all contact with them. anyways, i just start saying like ""what the hell is going on"" and ""im so confused,"" and she responded saying that at the party she had wanted to wrestle with somebody (like actually wrestle not like sex). i was kind of known for challenging guys to friendly matches while hanging out, but i never challenged a girl. anyways, she said that she was upset that nobody would wrestle with her, and that i came over and consoled her when she was sad. i then asked how she got the number. she said that i had given her mine, and i should have gotten hers. i said i didn't, then she said ""oh maybe it was my snapchat"" and gave me her snapchat. i typed the username into the search, and there were no results. after i continued going ""im so confused"" and stuff like that, she said ""i have to go now, bye"" and hung up.

after this, i just sat there trying to remember who this was. but then i remembered i saw something a couple of weeks ago saying scammers are trying to get you to say ""yes"" and ""ok"" so they can use the recordings to sign up for stuff. this is what i though at first, but then i thought ""how on earth could she know my school, the sport i played, and the name of the host of a party i went to last september."" i also have no memory of anything like this ever happening. i have private social media accounts, and dont respond to emails at all unless from my family or something i know i signed up for. even more confusing, when i looked at the party host's instagram to see who was following her, all the kaitlins and katelyns (and other spellings) had other schools and sports in their bios.

in all, i am just so confused about this call, and was wondering if anyone else has gotten something this specific and creepy. it may just be a prank call, or my memory, but i am absolutely certain that the events she described never happened. any idea on how this could be a scam?"

"scammed for a $11 burger \-my first time posting anything on reddit, so please give me some slack.

so, a bit of backstory: 

during march, mcdonald's had a promotion for its meals, including a 2 person meal that was down to $11. and so, i decided to check it out 

anyways, back to the story.

as this happened during the coronavirus pandemic, mcdonald's had its interiors closed and only allowed drive-throughs. so, i ordered my two meals, paid, picked it up soon after and prepared to drive off. 

all is well.

at least, until i noticed that they got my order wrong.

they messed up my order and only gave me one burger, instead of two. 

and so, i ran back to the window and told them i was missing a burger. but instead of helping me resolve this issue, they instead insisted that i go back and line up again.

i went back and lined up.

when it was my turn at the window, i explained the situation to them and they asked for my meal back as proof. i gave the meal back and waited patiently for my missing burger and the meal. a few minutes later, i saw a hand wave for me to come forward to collect my meal in another window. 

however, the wave was apparently a mistake-an employee mistook my car for a car waiting for an order, and thus waved me to come forward. 

and apparently, this was all the justification that mcdonald's needed to waive my order and force me to leave. apparently, according to them, i had waived my order during my move from the first window to the second and thus had to go around and order a new meal. 

this was unacceptable to me; i had *paid*, and i was asked to buy another meal just because i was ordered to another window? 

i refused to move, and only after a long and strenuous argument did i receive one burger in return, a quarter of what i paid for. i was then asked to leave, and at that point, i didn't even bother to argue anymore.

and that was how i paid $11 for a burger."

&gt; 1. the government will not ask you to pay anything up front to get this money. no fees. no charges. no nothing.
&gt; 1. the government will not call to ask for your social security number, bank account, or credit card number. anyone who does is a scammer.
&gt; 1. these reports of checks aren’t yet a reality. anyone who tells you they can get you the money now is a scammer."

shaverei.com - legit or not? i was looking for nintendo switch games on google and came across a website [shaverei.com](https://shaverei.com). they have tons of popular titles and are selling them for like $17 and $18. has anyone ordered from them before?

"cheap ps4 controller store - scam or not? hi! i came across this webshop yesterday while looking for a new ps4 controller: [https://arcticgamers.com/](https://arcticgamers.com/) 

why i am not certain whether or not this store is legit? their prices are way below what you can expect to pay at a retailer and there are barely any reviews or people talking about this website.

the redeeming factor: you can pay with paypal, which could act as a safety net in case you'd need a chargeback.

&amp;#x200b;

what do you guys think? is it safe to purchase a new controller via this webshop?"

**thanks for your reply. we own the place and our daughter lived there until 2 month ago when she got married and she moved to wa.**  
**that\`s why we decided to rent it.**  


**unfortunately, because of my job, it will be a bit difficult to meet you personally now, for the moment we are in ny and i am unable to travel right now. last week i came there to meet a couple who was interested, but they never showed up, and it's not comfortable to fly back and forth from ny, especially when work commitments are made. because of that we decide to make everything through airbnb, an international company that mainly deals with rentals.**  
**they will organize the inspection and will also assist you in managing the payment.**  


**i\`ll make the booking registration for you with airbnb, and they will send you by e-mail the booking confirmation containing all the rental information including the payment information.**  
**you\`ll have to make a down payment of 1 month of rent to airbnb and after they will receive it, an agent will be assigned for your reservation, which will contact you to inspect the place. can be even the same day when the down payment was made.**  


**if you like the place, you\`ll sign the lease, you\`ll get the keys from the airbnb agent and you can move in right away.**  
**the down payment is 100% refundable, after the inspection if you do not like the place and you do not want to rent it, airbnb will return your down payment in full immediately.**  


**if you would like to proceed, please give me your details (full name, current address and phone number) and we will make the registration for you with airbnb.**"

i googled the number, and it's the local purolator number, but it makes me suspicious because the lady said that it was shipped from another province, so how did it get all the way to my city without an address? also, i don't know anyone from that province, which makes it extra suspicious. anyway, i was just wondering if anyone else has encountered anything similar or if anyone has suggestions on what i should do...? thanks \~\~"

he then went on to tell me that if i clicked it i could download a car? 
i messed with him for a bit asking how i could download a car. he kept saying it’s not a physical car but i said what’s the point then? he told me i could download a car in to my files, i wanted to know what i could then do with that car in my files and he said i could drive it around? 
it really confused me. i know it was some sort of scam to get me to download something but i don’t know where it was heading. has anyone heard of this before?

"nigerian romance scam - lost $160k+ mil (f59) fell for a romance scam after signing up to plenty of fish.

she met 'james' (m43), who owned a 'global construction company' and was working in norway, but living between there and florida. we had warned her about the dangers of meeting people online, for both personal and financial safety. everything seemed kinda sketchy but we trusted that if anything was amiss mil would raise her concerns to us. 

this was going on for just under 3 months. their 'relationship' seemed normal as far as we could tell. he kept promising to come visit her but would always cancel last minute. three days ago she asked if norway had closed there borders because 'james' was insistent that he wasn't able to fly home because of coronavirus closures. after 5 minutes of googling, we found that the border was still open and that traveling home for an american citizen wouldn't be a problem. he claimed that he required a special flight for all of his equipment, so we scrolled through her messages to see what type of flight he was talking about and if it held any validity. we noticed that he had said a previous flight was going to cost $6000. this set off major red flags for us as no flight should cost $6000. after a huge meltdown and discussion it became clear that my mil had sent him money via a bitcoin atm downtown, but the amount was still unknown to us. 

she kept messaging james to try to get him to prove to me and my partner that he was real and was going to pay her the money back when we arrived. we had to prove to her that he was not the 'james' she had been talking to but a scammer trying to steal her money.

we used an ip tracking link to find his ip address, to prove to her that he wasn't based in norway and it came back that he was based in nigeria - specifically lagos. she still doesn't believe that he isn't  'james'. after a while it came out that she had sent him over $160,000 by withdrawing cash from her bank and taking it to a bitcoin atm, depositing the cash, and scanning his bitcoin scanner qr code.  she recently inherited $500,000+ from the passing of her husband in may, and still needs to pay over $130,000 in taxes. she currently has $37,000 left after paying her house off and 'loaning money to james' for these flights. she is now going to be in a major debt to the irs and has absolutely no savings. she makes $30,000 a year.

we're reporting this to fbi and going to go through whatever legal process we need to.

we just want to know what we can do now. we have his ip address and his bitcoin wallet code. is he traceable? can we recover anything from this?"

"bill gates email chain scam. what's the community think? this was on the 9:00 o'clock news the other night and this works. 

this took two pages of the tuesday usa today - it is for real pleeeeeease read it was on the news!

this thing is for real. rest assured aol and intel will follow through with their promises for fear of facing a multimillion-dollar class action suit. 

similar to the one pepsi cola company filed against general electric not too long ago.

dear friends; 

please do not take this for a junk letter. bill gates is sharing his fortune. should you ignore this, you will repent later. 

microsoft and aol are now the largest internet companies and in an effort to make sure that internet explorer remains the most widely used program.

microsoft and aol are running an e-mail beta test. when you forward this e-mail to friends, microsoft can and will track it (if you are a microsoft windows user)? 

for a two weeks time period. every individual person that you forward this e-mail to, microsoft will pay you $245.00  

for every one of the individuals that you sent it to and forwards it on.
microsoft will pay you $243.00! 

now for every third person that receives it, you will be paid $241.00 within two weeks. 

microsoft will reach out to you requesting your contact information (your address) and then send you a check.

my thoughts were this a scam however; two weeks after receiving this same e-mail.  
i forwarded it to family, colleagues and freinds. microsoft reached out via email asking for my address and within days, i receive a check for $24, 800.00.

you need to respond before the beta testing is over. if anyone can afford this, bill gates is the man that can.

how can he afford to do this? it's all marketing expense to him. 

please forward this to as many people as possible.

kind regards,

i told him i wasn’t comfortable taking his banking details and that he should use paypal or something similar to “protect himself”. he said the bank would protect him.
the next day he switched and said he would need my details. i reminded him that he said he wouldn’t and have him screenshots. 
he asked for my number and i have him one of those text app numbers then after two texts deleted the app and told him that shortly after texting him, someone tried to hack my phone so now i need to get a new phone and number. 
finally convinced him that he could “trust me” and he provided “his” banking details.
probably not super smart of me to be messing with him, but i don’t really have a life. lol. and i wanted to waste his time because i’m tired of scammers.
i know the details are not his and i’m not sure if they’re even real. part of me wants to just report him, and a very tiny part of me wants to see if it works but first i’m afraid this is just some random person’s account that he has stolen and i don’t want to take money from some poor victim of identity theft. the other part of me is scared that if i do it and it goes through, i’ll be the one to get in trouble, not him since he’s not who he says he is.

my sister told both of them that they need to change all of their passwords and contact their bank to get new debit/credit cards immediately. i am heading over later today (3am-ish currently)to see what happened but i am not very tech savvy. we also live in a semi-rural part of alaska and don't have access to a tech squad. any advice on where i should begin? all of my mom's pictures of the grandkids are on the computer and i would like to salvage what i can."
unexpected exness account so i just got a couple emails from something called exness saying that i've successfully registered my trading account and that my demo account is ready. i've never heard of exness before and i'm wondering what the best course of action (if any) i should take in response to this unexpected registration?

"oh my god t3h c0r0n4v1ru5 new emails floating around. seen about 1,000 today... spammers are really hammering hard. 

this should be scamming101 around here, but thought i would post it for a chuckle anyway. 

&gt; oh my god.
 
as you read this, i don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, i believe everyone will die someday. my name is mullin yato evans a merchant in china and dubai.i have been diagnosed with covid-19.it has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now i have only about a few weeks to live, according to medical experts. i have not particularly lived my life so well, as i never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my businesses.
 
though i am very rich, i was never generous,i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for.
 
but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life in a different way from how i have lived it.
 
now that god has called me, i have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so,i have decided to give also to charity organizations, as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth. so far, i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u.a.e, algeria, malaysia and some countries in africa. now that my health has deteriorated so badly, i cannot do this myself anymore.
 
i had recently asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. hence, i do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contented with what i have left for them. the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of two hundred and eleven million united states dollars $211,000,000,00 that i have with a financial holding firm abroad.
 
i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. i have set aside 10% for you, your time and also any expenses incured during this assignment. god be with you.
 
kindly reply me on my confidential email account : emailremoved@someaddress
 
god bless you greatly as you do.
 
regards,
mullin yato evans"
i think i just told a scammer where i live....what do i do? my phone rang 10 minutes ago and it said the caller id was a lady and i just answered it out of curiosity. the person who answered was a dude and said he had panago pizza order for me and i was surprised because i didn't order pizza. i thought maybe my husband who is away right now ordered it for me to be nice. i texted him and he didn't respond right away. i called the pizza man back because i couldn't find my wallet and i didn't want them to stand outside too long and said i don't think my husband ordered me any pizza. he surprised me because he said my husbands first and last name and i thought maybe i was wrong. he asked what neighborhood i live in and he said he was in a different town and i thought maybe my husband called the wrong place. so i called him a few minutes ago to ask about the pizza and he said he did no such thing and it was probably a scam. o.o i wish i could have a weapon.
"nintendo switch on letgo? hi, i've spent some time looking for an affordable switch to buy for my brother. i saw a deal on letgo for $180 with games. i asked the seller to send a photo of the switch in the eshop. he sent one with the switch showing the news page, but the news page was from november 2019.  


he says he is going to ship the item to me through paypal (i trust paypal). he says he works for a company and that he couldn't get me more photos because he had already given the switch to his boss and didn't want to bother him anymore. that was a red flag for me. but i really really want a switch and i'm desperate. should i yolo and trust paypal to have my back if anything wrong happens? thanks.

"rumble media company | if your video has earned a large amount, you most likely will not get paid. a few years ago, i received a message from rumble with a proposal to acquire the rights to the video. i agreed and forgot about it. after some time, an amount of $5000 was accumulated. i decided to get them out, but i ran into a problem. it can't be that simple, right? first, 2 weeks have passed since the withdrawal and the money just hung on the account. no one even contacted me about this! i wrote in support and they answered that in connection with some problem i need to confirm the rights to the video by copying the text under my video on youtube. but, unfortunately, i can’t do this, because i stopped using this google account for a long time, where the video is uploaded and google just doesn’t let it into my account, despite the fact that i know the password and go through additional verification steps. many people have a similar problem (you can google an expensive ramble team) due to the fact that they do not go to their google account for a long time, they change their place of residence and computer. but they absolutely do not care. they don’t care that i have this video in better quality than on youtube.

thus, this is the only way for rumble, how can i confirm my authorship and receive money. plus, the agreement does not say anything about it. but despite this, they used and earned money all the time on my video, not being sure that i was the author? in my opinion, they do it just to not pay.

in general, i advise you to bypass this company.

"skype sextortion i know i am dumb for falling for this but it seemed very real to me at the time. i met a girl on omegle and she asked to go to skype. she doesn’t have my real name or email, but she did get my actual phone number. she wanted to video chat and i was easily distracted at the time and thought why not. i ended up getting naked up the camera with my face (i know very dumb). the call ended and she called me back and it was a replay of me naked in front of the camera. she said i could pay a certain amount of money for it to be deleted or she would post it on twitter, instagram, and facebook. i know this was a scam so i blocked her closed all communications. she had my number but i made sure to remove all my numbers from my social media. so she has a fake name, fake email, but a real phone number, and a video of me nude. i have a few questions:
1. it has been a few days and nothing has happened, am i in the clear?
2. what can she do with my phone number?
3. what happens to the video she took of me, will it get deleted, will she post it without me knowing, and will it have a negative affect on me in the future?

"extorted for sexually explicit screen shots i've recently been extorted for money by someone whom i've never met through an interaction on facebook. we had a couple of mutual friends so i accepted the request and she began messaging me telling me she though i was familiar and was from an area close to me, like the dumbass i am, i fell for it. she asked if i liked sex, i said yes and she asked if we could video chat, i again said yes. as soon as i opened the video, she claimed to have no mic (my personal theory is that those who or running this operation were in the room and that a mic would give them away) the interaction lasted 2 minutes, she asked to see me, i obliged like the dumbass i am. though note, my face and genitals were never in the video together, i have no tattoos, so there's nothing to identify me other than my face, in which nothing else was in those screen capturesthen she quickly asked for a phone number, i said no and hung up immediately and deactivated my facebook. within the next 5 minutes i received texts from a new jersey phone number telling me that these screenshots would be sent to my friends, family, workplace and potential workplaces and that i would have legal action taken towards me if i didn't send money. they claimed the girl in the video was underage, she looked to be in her 30s, clearly not a teenager, and english is clearly not her first language if that makes any difference. i was instructed to send 800 dollars and that once that was complete i would be sent a link to erase my images. i immediately informed my roommates and we made arrangements to call one of their friends in the early stages of law school. we determined that this was an absolute scam and that without images of my face and genitals together this would likely fall flat. i was given a deadline to pay, i ceased all contact and did not pay. throughout the day i've been receiving numerous phone calls and texts threatening to release these images. their most recent act was to attempt to upload it to youtube. through their insane title which included the words masturbate and pedophile my roommates, law school friend, and i deemed that this must be fake because there's no way youtube algorithms would allow a video with a title that graphic,i could not access the video and none of my friends could either, and they also allow very little nudity on the site. they've since threatened to send the images to my old place of work (where my mom also works and i currently substitute teach when we're not in the midst of a global pandemic, and my dad is also school board president). i'm wondering what action i should take from here? should i get legal representation? should i block their numbers and just leave it alone? looking for any advice, thank you.

note: the money was ordered to be sent to several different non-ethnic, very generic names in burkina faso and the ivory coast. i've also read the master thread on this page discussing this sort of thing, only posting to determine if there are any unique differences in my case.

edit: in their scare tactics they also mentioned organizations like instagram which allows zero nudity, national geographic, msn messenger, and i think animal planet, they just wrote planet."

me:  yes, speaking.

*silence*

me:  hello?

*call disconnects* 

they have not called again.  first of all, why would someone ask for me specifcally, then immediately hang up when i confirmed?  also, how did this person know my name?  i have always used fake names when signing up for stuff.  i also looked up the number and it seems to belong to ""mr opinion poll.""  was this one of those voice sample scams where they get you to say ""yes"" or something, then use the recording to steal your identity?"

"someone calling me and leaving me voicemail about an unattended package addressed to me hi i'm pretty weirded out by this. 

i'm working in the us, and i got calls from them twice so far. the first time i picked up, a prerecorded message spoke to me in chinese that i have a package addressed to me that needed to be picked up. i pressed a number to take to a real person as i was told, when a guy answered me, the first thing he asked is my name. i was like how come you know my number, know i speak chinese, and have my package but not my name, so i hung up without telling him anything.

just now they called again and left a voice mail, it's the same as the prerecorded message.

the first time the number is from ny, if i remember correctly, this time it is from las vegas, i don't live in either of the places.

got sent an ipad? just wondering if i should be worried about this... so one day a few weeks ago my email was flooded with new subscription welcome messages i had not subscribed to. i didn’t think anything of it until i scrolled down to delete the messages and noticed one of them was a confirmation of purchase. i responded to that one and explained that i had not made a purchase and was assured that it would be scrapped. i don’t remember who sent that confirmation email anymore and have since deleted it but a few days ago i received a brand new ipad pro in an amazon box with my name and information. there’s also an amazon receipt inside which i don’t think i’ve ever received before. has anyone ever heard of anything like this? i’m tempted to open the ipad and call it a win but not sure. also worth mentioning that i have an amazon account and have not been charged. the order number on the receipt doesn’t register either.
"company selling clorox wipes listed my phone number as their own? i am not sure if this is an intended scam, a weird mistake, or what..

turns out a recently created “janitorial services” website has my number all over their site and social media. the website doesn’t really function all that well, the only thing that really works is the ordering process.

i just called back to try and get some more information. they were accurately able to tell me the date and time i purchased my ticket to the concert, the email associated with the account, my billing zip, and obviously they have my phone number as well. with this much information, i'm tempted to think it's not a scam?"

"my elderly father fell for a email phishing scam. he entered the username and passwords to both his aol and gmail accounts. he didn't tell me about this until 10 days later. what now? hi everyone, i could really appreciate some advice. i'm in my 20s and my father is in his 60s. ten days ago, my dad received a link from his landlord to open a dropbox link. unfortunately, the landlord has legitimately sent him information over dropbox before, so he opened the link. the webpage prompted him to enter his email address and password. he entered his aol info and, when nothing happened, he tried again with his gmail username and password. then he called the landlord who said ""my email was hacked, don't open that link"". he deleted the email and didn't give a second though to it. 

&amp;#x200b;

10 days later (today), he received 150 emails saying ""message failed to send"" and several phone calls from friends asking ""john, what is this dropbox email you sent me?"". clearly, the malware spammed his entire contact list with the same phishing link. i just installed malwarebytes and ran it on his computer and it didn't detect anything. we also changed his passwords today. i'm primarily concerned because the scammer had unfettered access to his email accounts for 10 days. those accounts contain emails and documents with my entire family's social security numbers in them......

&amp;#x200b;

is it too optimistic to hope that they only hijacked his email to get more of his contacts to keep spamming people? or is my family's social security numbers probably already on the dark web?

thing is, she never signed up for this credit card. we've never heard of the company, and never received an actual card in the post. 

she is self employed, and her business is listed on companies house. so we're wondering:

1. is this a scam?
2. is it possible to set up a credit card using just the details available on companies house?
3. could someone have intercepted our post and taken the card?

i did not respond to the message. i simply blocked the number and deleted the texting, thinking that would solve the problem. i thought it was kind of funny, as i'd never received this kind of message via text before, so i sent a screenshot to my friends and we all laughed about jack, a man who just wanted to have a good time. but the next day i received another message, similar to the one before, but from a different number. i figured it was strange that i got another message within a span of two days, but left it as nothing more than a coincidence and did the same thing (minus the screenshot to my friends). now this morning, on the third day, i wake up to this: 

[a shitstorm.](https://preview.redd.it/f5xv9vpqkgo41.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43f6b21e5a4ddffb2ffe3ff30a3b81ad649ec515)

the first message went like this:

all of these messages have similar formatting and all but the previous photo mention the name jack. i don't really know what to do here, or how someone got my phone number, but i'm really worried. i'm underage and messages like these make me really uncomfortable. does anyone know how i can get these texts to stop and prevent something like this from happening again? all help is appreciated!

note: i've changed my instagram profile from public to private, and haven't gotten any inappropriate messages today, so hopefully that'll solve that issue... but i doubt it'll do anything for these texts."
"potential paypal scam please help hi, i posted a macbook on ebay and someone said they wanted to buy it. they asked for my paypal email and said they sent the money. i got the confirmation email in my spam folder which was a combined paypal/ebay confirmation email.  i checked my ebay and it still says that the post is active and no one has bought it or sent an offer. i also checked my paypal account and see no pending transactions. i replied to the confirmation email to service@paypal. com and an email account: paypalcustomerservice119@gmail. com replied. i have never seen a paypal email account like this and i think this could be a scam even though the confirmation email looks extremely professional and paypay-like. please help."
"am i being scammed? so i am talking to a potential sugar daddy, but now they're saying that they can only send me money through mobile deposit, which i've heard is a scam. i offered paypal/venmo but they said that they were scammed by a sugar baby before through 3rd-party apps like this (and i don't see how this is possible.) they asked which bank i use-- can they scam me just with that basic info? 

(i've seen their id and did some googling and they look like a real person, but now i'm really suspicious.) there's no money in my account to start with, if tthat makes a difference. if they just send me a pic of a check, is there a way tto tell if it's fraudulent? am i just being dumb? i want to believe it's real but i'm not blind lol. thanks guys."
"pelham update for those of you that saw my post involving the gun purchase in pelham:
it's resolved. called the police, they said to disregard it and the scammer was probably hoping i would call them instead of the police. thanks for the help."
this is a unique spelling of that word.... 
"beware: this online scammer actually sued reddit posters and commenters for exposing him (after nearly a year in the ny state supreme court the case was rightfully disposed) and he returned to social media collecting over $9,000 for ""legal fees."" look him up... it's sickening! "

"inappropriate scam messages... through text hey, so this is my first post on reddit. i have never used this site before because it's just never really piqued my interest, but honestly, i'm a little freaked out and quite desperate. i need some advice/help/anything you can offer. here's the issue:

for the past few days, i've been receiving spam messages. you know, the ones that go something along the lines of ""hey wanna date xoxo \[link\]"" or ""wanna see hot s3x pictures of me? aha click link for fun time \[link\]"". they typically have horrible grammar/sound like they were written by a bot and sometimes ""sensor"" what they're saying. i get these kinds of dms on instagram all the time, but i always ignore them and delete them immediately-- and by all the time i mean about two to three times a day. well, this time, none of that has worked and it's gotten worse.

it started about three days ago, when i received a text message (on my personal phone number) from someone claiming to know a ""jack"" with this phone number. here's the actual text and number sent to my phone:

[the first message, received circa 3\/20\/20](https://preview.redd.it/j02ee2d8qfo41.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae45e257bdfcdf0444d7ca640acc351d4e074318)

i did not respond to the message. i simply blocked the number and deleted the texting, thinking that would solve the problem. i thought it was kind of funny, as i'd never received this kind of message via text before, so i sent a screenshot to my friends and we all laughed about jack, a man who just wanted to have a good time. but the next day i received another message, similar to the one before, but from a different number. i figured it was strange that i got another message within a span of two days, but left it as nothing more than a coincidence and did the same thing (minus the screenshot to my friends). now this morning, on the third day, i wake up to this:

all of these messages have similar formatting and all but the previous photo mention the name jack. i don't really know what to do here, or how someone got my phone number, but i'm really worried. i'm underage afab (use they/them pronouns) and messages like these make me really uncomfortable. does anyone know how i can get these texts to stop? all help is appreciated!"
"discord paypal invites, scam? im on a discord server and the owner posted a link to a server where you invite people and you get money through paypal. is this a scam. also, the person has been posting loads of these things, giveaways etc. recently, even though they seemed normal 1 week ago, could a scammer have taken over their account, or is this legit?"

"a scam on reddit. be careful. people will slide into your dm's on reddit, and say something along the lines of showing their body, and put a link with wawadating in it. i'm not an idiot, so i don't know what kinda viruses you get from it, but be careful lads. it's people with 0 karma who usually send this shit."
of course they did! 
is this some kind of scams? thanks in advance. 
no way this is real right?

i found this motorcycle online and figured i would make an offer on it because it was such a good deal. the person said they were selling it for a neighbor, and gave me an email and said nothing else.  so i email them asking for some photos, and nothing more.  later, i go to the profile of the guy who posted it, and realized that he posted the same bike, countless times, in different cities, all the same price, and the same photo. i believe he dodged the algorithm by cropping each photo differently with a different color background. also, one guy went to each of the posts and in bold wrote phishing email scam. so now i am worried. is it bad that i sent an email to this email? i included no personal information, besides the email address i sent the email with."
this just smacks of an identity theft scam 
why would they request this? is it shady? 
"have my vin to a possible buyer. did i mess up? i’m selling my car on craigslist. someone texts me, “hi  is the sale for your bmw available still?”
i said it is, and they sent me all this, “last week test drove a very similar make in (city near me) and it was not anything like the pictures” 
“2/2 he corona outbreak but really need a new vehicle!”
“1/2 i'll come to you in the next couple of days or maybe today if you can grab a vehicle history check on the bmw please. i am healthy and want to respect t”
so i started typing and then they asked if i was still there. i replied and said i was looking for one and i sent them the vin. 

“the best place to get one is: www.autobgreviewteam.com i googled around and its the best choice”
“either email it to (made up email 212)@yahoo.com or just text me screenshot”

so i texted a screenshot of a free vin check page. i tried to call but it went to voicemail and they texted that it wasn’t a good time to call. 
now i feel like i got scammed somehow, is there anything i can do about it now? or am i just being paranoid?"
i won $20’000! just gotta click a unsafe looking link... does anyone else get these on facebook? 
they know my name... should i be concerned?

"i’m not sure what the goal of this scam was... my friend answered a job advertisement on craigslist. she sent her resume. she received a reply a few hours later telling her she has an appointment for an interview at 12 o’clock the next day and to be punctual. upon arrival at the address, the building security guard told her there is no company with that name at that address. a woman who got the same email was also there trying to get to her interview. they showed the guard the email and asked if this has happened before. he told them to leave the building if they didn’t have any actual business with anyone there, and wouldn’t give them any information. they both walked back to the subway confused. 

i asked my friend if she thought the other woman was in on it, but she said she arrived dressed formally with the email in hand and genuinely seemed like she thought she was going to a job interview as well.

the phone number for the company goes straight to voice mail. the name of the hr person that contacted her is the actual name of a person working in hr in a nearby city for a similar company.

in my own googling they post the same job advertisement in numerous cities.

we can’t figure out what the scammers get from collecting resumes. we also can’t figure out why they have a fake phone number set up, and why they are summoning people for fake interviews...

any thoughts?"

so back in november i was on pof and messaged this girl who on her profile said she was 23 like all the other profiles, we exchanged numbers she said some iffy words after i asked what she was looking for basically said a relationship and said “in my 17 years of experience i have never been with a guy” and so it never caught my eye that she could be 17 years old even tho being 23 and having 17 years of sexual experience never really added up. we did exchange some sexual photos as it usually goes. we did talk on the phone briefly and she ghosted me for a little and then all of a sudden i get a call saying from a “private investigator” that the mom is crying that her daughter overdosed after she took her phone away and saw messages from me. and she said she didn’t want to go to the police so i hung up cause i figured it was a scam as it usually might be even tho she never claimed that she wanted any type of money i assumed that she would eventually. and so it’s been a few months and every time i get a call from that certain city my stomach turns yah know? like a pain. i am basically looking for ways to get this off my mind because i know it’s fake because they would’ve already been at my door otherwise."

i immediately regretted my decision to do this, even though i received a text back from her. i read all about sim swapping, porting and all that, so i immediately went onto my account settings for my phone carrier, locked my number against sim swapping, set up a bunch of new security protocols, and then called my carriers customer support to ask if any suspicious activity besides the changes i made had occurred today, and she told me that everything looked fine. i confirmed that it was a scammer just a moment ago from someone’s post on reddit where the bot/scammer said the exact same thing that i was sent.

realistically, the scammer only has my number and my name, i don’t list any social media or emails or anything on my tinder profile. is there really anything they could do with that information besides sell it to telemarketers? i feel like i’ve covered all my bases by securing my phone account, but i just want to be sure."

"help: someone's been texting me, they know my name and keep sending a link saying its video proof of someone knowing private info? i'm 17f i've been repeatedly getting texts from an anonymous phone number saying that someone is talking about me and they're sending video proof. i normally ignore this but they used informal language and called me by my obscure nickname that only my friends use.

it goes like this:

yo \[obscure nickname\], someone is spilling secrets about you on this app wtf. i'll send you a video link of it:

the link was [https://join.itsme.video/link/1](https://join.itsme.video/link/1)

too scared to click on the app but what the hell?"

"weird email from zoom — what’s going on? apologies if this isn’t the proper place to post this; i’m not sure where to try.
i received an email from zoom today asking me to authenticate my account by clicking a link. i’ve used zoom for work, but that was under a different account. the email that i got today went to my personal account, and i haven’t signed up for zoom using this email address. it looks like a pretty legit email. 
anyway, i didn’t click the link and decided to send support a message letting them know what was going on. when i got the email letting me know that my support request had been received, it was super weird — it looks like someone made an account using my email. there’s a username that matches my email address (which contains my first and last name) and there’s even an old picture of me set as the icon for this zoom account. this picture is really old — the only place i know it’s been uploaded is an fb account that has since been deactivated. 
i don’t know how to access this zoom account because i have no idea what the sign in information is and i never confirmed the account. i change my email passwords pretty frequently as i’ve experienced people getting ahold of some of my info during some site breaches. 
sorry that this is rambly, but i’m kinda creeped out and don’t know what to do. 
tl;dr — got a “confirm your account” email from zoom when i never created an account. sent a message to support using the same email, and the confirmation for my support ticket included a username and old profile pic from a deactivated facebook account. i don’t understand what’s going on and haven’t read about this happening to anyone else — any ideas?"
i don’t even have that bank 
the rest of the message states that they have recorded me (a minor) masturbating after hacking into my apple laptop from a trojan virus. requesting $950 through bitcoin as ransom. i have indeed masturbated in front of my computer. any chance this is legit?

"odd entrepreneur hey everyone! this is my first reddit post so bear with me here. 

 i work a grocery store in the middle of town. two people come up to me a husband and a wife, then ask where the toilet paper is. this isn't a weird question or anything, i was used to answering this because covid-19 virus is currently sweeping the world. we got into a short conversation about why  panic buying is ridiculous and it needs to stop. after everything is said and done with i go back to what i was doing before they came and spoke to me.

shortly after the husband comes up to me and asks if my current job is my long term career choice. i responded ""no, i'm only doing this until i find what i want to do with my life."" he told me he had a lot of connections and could get me set up with other jobs. something long term instead of my current job. he said he liked my personality and wanted to help me out. he asked for my name and number so i gave it to him.

i'm not that great in social situations like this and i panic on the inside. i know i probably shouldn't have given my information but i did. 

a day later he asked me over the phone if i wanted to do a zoom app meeting just to get to know me better. so i agreed. he asked me what my work ethic was like, my leadership skills, and what my weaknesses were. he said near the end of the call was that he wanted to get me enrolled in success seminars and other projects with other people who are going through the same thing i am (kind of like a class of some kind).

he told me he was an entrepreneur and wanted to know if i was accountable or trustworthy for this whole thing. i'm still unsure how to feel. i'm not sure what to do right now.

thanks to anyone who read the whole post any advice would be helpful thank you! :)"

"getting scammed, need advice urgently 
i was selling 2 million fifa coins to someone on reddit for $200. we decided to do incremental payments since i didnt wanna sell all of it without the money. so i sent him a player thats worth roughly 400k fifa coins. he now wants me to buy it back for 600k and then he’ll supposedly send me $70.

the buyer had a fake rep page and i just realized now that hes a scammer. he has no idea that i’m on to him so i want a creative way to get him to trade my player back to me. any ideas?"

"am i being sued or scammed !? what do you guys think? any input to confirm that this might be a scam is appreciated!

yesterday, i received a call from an ‘unknown’ number and a lady asked for a name. now i have to explain, i legally have two last names and in the u.s it’s common to assume that my second last name is my only last name and my first last name is my middle name because i don’t have a middle name just a first name...this happens a lot. any way, the lady asked “i’m looking for [first name] [second last name]” i said yes that’s me because i’m so used to this happening. she then said that someone filed a civil complaint against me and that they were going to go to my place of work or home to get a signature to deliver papers. this lady did not have an accent in case you were thinking this is someone calling from a foreign country. i was honestly in shock thinking about who or why someone would do a civil complaint against me. she proceeded to tell me that she did not have any information, was just going to deliver and get the signature on tuesday. she gave me a phone number to call so they can provide me with more details. the call ended and i called the number. no one answered just a voice mail that said they were busy assisting other clients. i’ve called several times since then and no answer. i googled the phone number and no business came up under it. also the phone number is from texas and i live in nevada.  i was freaking out trying to figure out what just happened, friends were trying to assure it was a scam so i did research and found out that there are scams like this but none of the articles i read seemed to touch on all the details of my situation. most said they would ask for money but the lady never mentioned having to pay anything. i even went as far as contacting a redditor who had posted a similar situation on r/scams and he said that for him it was a scam. i’m still not sure, it’s making me uneasy. i am more certain that this might be a scam but not completely sure still. i’m waiting for tuesday to see if someone shows up at either my mom’s house (i already warned her not to give any info or just don’t open the door at all) or they come to my apartment. 

red flags
-if it was a legal matter i would expect them to use my actual legal name with both last names.
-the phone number is from texas, i’m in nevada (have no ties to anyone/businesses in texas)
-i have received no mail from anyone advising me they would be taking legal action against me
-the lady did not mention the world “getting served”
-i read that process servers should be able to give some detail of the documentation they’re serving
-i was not given a case number by phone

"my elderly father god scammed into releasing private information hi, so my father received a call from an anonymous number. the woman seemed to have all sorts of information on my family. she claimed to be from social security administration, and had sensitive information on my father and my sister, and asked for details about both of them. my guess, she was able to access their physical mailbox, and took a letter(s) from social security administration. he ended up giving her all the information she asked for including their ssn. i was able to trace the phone number down and figure out the individuals first name (i don't know if i am allowed to post it here). my suspicion is this is someone local.

yes, it was very stupid for him to fall for something so obvious. i am baffled and confused myself, yet it happened. i have since printed instructions out for my parents and posted it in the house for them, so they know what to do in situations like this or even when a legitimate government organization calls.

i am not exactly sure how to go about this. i have set an appointment with his bank today to go figure some of this out. social security administration offices are closed over the weekend, and week as well due to corona. i am calling equifax (or one of the credit bureau) and informing them of that.  if someone is able to help me further track this number down it would be appreciated, and/or guide me as to what to do. thank you for your time."

q1- many of these women are desperate single moms and cheating wives looking for some fun. they could be your neighbors or someone you know. do you agree to keep the identity of these women a secret?

q2- these women have asked us to not allow men that are seeking a ""relationship"". they only desire quick sex. not dating. do you agree to this request?

q3- to prevent any problems. you will have to use a condom when you have sex with the women on our site. is this a problem for you?

q4- are you at least 24 years old? the women have requested that we not let those younger than 24 contact them because of past rude behavior by younger men.

i put up a rental listing on fb. this ""girl"" friended me on fb(which i accepted) and told me to text her about the details because she's interested in the place. i was stupid enough to share my exact apt address(im not there rn), that im out of town and that i live alone before i caught onto the red flags(fake fb account, no venmo, urgency, kept asking me to respond). she acted like she was super interested and want to send me a check right away to secure her spot. she asked for my full name and my address to make the check payable to. i didn't respond to that part, but she still knows my full name from fb and my apt address. once i saw her fb url didn't match up to her actual fb name, i immediately unfriended her on fb and made the google doc that had my exact address on it private and deleted the address. this is prob too late tho.

if this is a fake check scam, then i'm not as worried because now i know to never cash it out. i am worried about how much personal info she has of me. i know a lot of these info i gave out are kinda public, but knowing this person put in a great effort to approach me with malicious intent and since i live alone, my mind is all over true crime stuff. where should i go from there? do i report it to the local police? file a complaint on ftc? and how should i best protect myself going forward?"

"i don’t know if i avoided a scam or was just rude to an innocent person so earlier today i got a text saying “hey” immediately followed by a derogatory term typically used against women. text exchange [here](https://imgur.com/a/2b9uroz) 

i have a naturally guilty personality and now feel like i may have just been incredibly harsh on someone who was simply given the wrong phone number. 

so i did black out names in that post, but the person who texted me said they got my number from someone that i’ll call j. i only know 4 people with that name, and only one of them has my number and we literally haven’t spoken since high school, all other js i know do not have my number.

also i sent two texts after what’s shown in the screen shots that sent as text message rather than imessage that got no response, and i took the time to look up the phone number myself to find that the person lives in a different state from me.

obviously my thought was that someone was trying to pull the whole “oops wrong number lol, but you seem cool, tell me about yourself” scam, but part of me thinks that either a, this person was given the wrong number by someone with the same name as a close friend, or b, this person actually does know me but was lying about their own name for some reason."

i am never been so embarrassed and stupid in my whole life. basically, i got scammed twice from r/giftcardexchange and r/gctrading respectively. i am new to the world of trading. it began around a week ago, i successfully sold my mobile game account to somebody in another subreddit. he gave me a generous amount of money via paypal. i wanted to use my money on amazon but amazon does not accept paypal payments so i decided to look for amazon gift cards in r/giftcardexchange. i posted my request asking for a big amazon gift card. somebody private-messaged an hour later me telling me he have what i wanted. i searched his username on usl, he wasn't banned. what i didn't realize at that time is that i forgot to check on the details box which shows which subreddits he was banned from (i later found out that he was banned from that subreddit for scamming). also i foolishly ignored the fact that he didn't comment on my post which is a big red flag. i already asked him why he didn't comment on my post he said that he only violated rule two and i didn't care much. i lost \~$50 as a consequence.

more recently, i fell to another scammer after i asked for a cheaper amazon gift card in r/gctrading. he was a notorious scammer from usl. i didn't realize until it was too late. i opened disputes in paypal but they denied because i sent payments via friends and family option which limited my rights as a customer. the worst thing is that my paypal account isn't linked to a bank account (i'm a high-schooler, i don't have one yet). that means i have no way to recover my lost money if my bank account is linked i could file a chargeback to get my money back. i learned an entire lesson in a hard way it cost me around $70. it's really a lot of money to me i can buy many things.

let me give advice to anybody especially future traders who want to trade gift cards on certain subreddits, **always check if the person you are trading with is in usl don't proceed if he's in that list** and **follow the rules, it will help you to avoid scam, don't underestimate the rules!** scams can happen to anybody, it can happen to you before you realize it. one more thing, paypal is a fucking shit get rid of it as soon as possible. paypal is merely a business not your bank, they don't care about your personal problems.

it really sucked a lot because there's a cheap book i really want to buy but i don't have sufficient balance and it's really hard to earn good money while in high school :/.

tl;dr: i got scammed twice, i lost most of my hard-earned money."
messing with a scammer for the past 4 weeks or so i have been messing with a scammer who followed me on instagram. they used pictures of a famous instagram model for themselves. i've been playing dumb and i don't think they've realized yet. they messed up today when they messaged me on whatsapp from a different number with a nigerian country code. i haven't confronted them however and i want to keep messing with them. what else could i do to mess with them? i always refuse to send them money but play completely dumb when it comes to realizing their true identity.

"friend/plug is trying to scam me sorry, this is my first time really trying to post something.

so today i went to buy from my dealer. i got some grams of shrooms and bud from him, priced at 50 and 40 respectively. after i leave he calls and shows me saying i only gave him half the amount. i go back to our spot to see if it fell, and ask him to check his pockets again. i counted the money three times before we met up, along with only pulling out the exact amount from the bank so there’s not any confusion. what do i do? he’s my coworker as well and i’ll most likely be confronted by him monday."

they're making money from users who will likely lose their money. brave has an affiliate link. you can see it when you hover the etoro link: [https://partners.etoro.com/b12165\_a84346\_tclick\_suk.aspx](https://partners.etoro.com/b12165_a84346_tclick_suk.aspx)

they won't directly say it's an affiliate link. and they haven't got an affiliate disclaimer. but, that is 100% an etoro affiliate link.

you can see what etoro pays per signup here and see why it's lucrative:  [https://www.affiliateprograms.com/p/etoro-partners/](https://www.affiliateprograms.com/p/etoro-partners/)

so, when a user signs up owners of brave browser are getting up to $200 per user, and a share of etoro's profits from that user.

for a project that is open source, and promotes security, privacy and good advertising i think this is kind of shady. if you click the affiliate link right at the bottom of brave the etoro page says this:

my question, assuming this is indeed a scam site, is how do they make money?

"medtronic job offer scam hey everyone, 

i recently received an email for a job offer from a company called medtronic. in short, they offered me a remote job opportunity and set up an interview. i interviewed over an instant messaging app called glip (should have been first red flag, i know). after the interview, they requested i send over documents of proof of residency. i sent them a paystub and a scan of my driver's license. they then told me that i received the job and sent me an offer which i signed. the next day, they sent me a check for $3,950.50 which was supposedly meant to pay for the materials required for the job (laptop, shredder, printer, laminator, etc.). i stupidly deposited the check into my bank. 

today, i called the hr office of the real medtronic and they informed me of all the red flags as to why this was a fraudulent offer. i then called my bank and informed them of the fraudulent activity. they had already detected this and cancelled the check and charged me a $12 cancellation fee. i then had them cancel my debit card and issue me a new one. i filed a police report at my local department. i also transferred all of the money in my bank accounts into a different account. 

i am wondering, are there any other steps that i should take asap with the information they have of mine? they have: a paystub, a scan of my driver's license, a receipt from the depositing of the check, and whatever information came from me depositing the check into my account. they do not have my social security.

"steps to take to avoid illegitimate websites. hi all, 

i'd say i'm pretty familiar with the vast majority of common scams taking place across different platforms, but less so spotting fake websites. 

however i came across a site the other day for a particular midi keyboard. it was ofcourse a link in the shopping tab of google's search. i am ofcourse, aware of how easily scam ads can be paid to be promoted in these lists but it kind of threw a spanner in the works for me. now from what i can tell the site is infact legitimate with a maintained/updated site and numerous reviews on sites not related to the website but isn't the issue here. 

now usually i'd purchase products from stores/websites i'm familiar with, however this particular product is not something i've ever purchased before and i wasn't familiar with a lot of the websites. it got me thinking, what steps can be taken to determine the legitimacy of websites you are suspicious of? maybe i'm just hyper critical of these sort of things but i'd rather be safe than sorry. if there's already posts/mega threads on this stuff i'd appreciate any links otherwise feel free to weigh in on steps you may take in similar situations or any recommendations.

"victim of sextortion here help!!!! please read so everything started 4 days ago, as every single story of this starts, i met this girl in a dating app where you can’t see the name and ask me if we can do video chat in google hangout, (the curious thing is that i offer her my facebook but “she” told me that she doesn’t have one) before i texted her i decided to use a gmail account that have no information of mine nor my real name, well as the story goes she told me to show my face and i showed half of my face, and my d.
 after that in the chat she shows me the screenshots and asked my that if i don’t wanted her to post it on social media and “being a disgrace to my family” i had to pay, which i replied that i lived in south korea and that i was underage, she told me to go to my parents and tell them to talk to him, which i didn’t i was trying to make time to change my name in all social media in case and then she showed me a picture of a person which he said he was the sister.  the person in the hospital needing help and needing 5000 hundreds of dollars. of course i didn’t believe it, so i was just like “please don’t post them, i have no money”. trying to get in the scammer mind i did not worked
she said that i had 10 seconds to go to my parents and put them in the phone( i didn’t do it)

“she” keep saying that she was going to post it in google, facebook, twitter, vimeo, and linkedin and those websites, and then i realized that’s actually not posible since in youtube you can’t post those kind of stuff, which i reply “why you making believe on something that i wrong” “you know what show me the video” right after i said that she send a terrifying message which was like “im the demon you can go anywhere i don’t care you better pray im going to get the police in you.”

then i replied ok but show me the videos, she kept avoiding that and said ok, she never show me the video (just screenshots of it which were send after call), and after my annoyance and insisting her to showing me the video the person(scammer) blocked me, i was insisting too much, i’m guessing that’s what make the person blocked me and just saying ok(once). after that they didn’t try to contact me or nothing. i deleted my gmail account forever, i didn’t used it for nothing.

so points and questions 

1. they don’t have  information about me not real name nothing no phone number nothing about me, not even my social media.

2. they haven’t contacted me. since the incident

3. the scammer is from a south american country 
questions
1.  i want to know if they actually post the videos? if they have no information about me and how much they take to post it?????

2. should i be worried? the scammer told me that he going to send it around the area i live but he doesn’t know where i live.

"""i met a couple who retired in their 30s who mentored me"" i know this is a scam, i'm just curious what it is. probably a pyramid scheme? but the fact that the exact same thing happened to me twice has piqued my interest.

i, a young woman, am shopping alone. another young woman is passing by me and compliments me on something i'm wearing. i say thank you and she asks me where it's from. then she asks more things under the guise of friendly small talk - like what do i do for school/work etc. then she works in that she met a couple who retired in their 30s and really mentored her and showed her the way to financial freedom, no longer a slave to a paycheck, etc. this happened twice to me, like 3 years ago and today. i really don't want to deal with getting caught up in whatever pitch they have so i pull myself out of the situation and leave quickly. it's just really bizarre to me that it was basically the same exact tactic both times - stranger in a public place making small talk. does anyone know what this is about?"

"victim to sextortion. need advice. so this happened last night. i've been talking to this girl on facebook for about 3 days. she seemed legit, has a lot of photos of herself on her profile. we started chatting, then one thing lead to another, we were both naked with our bits out in the open. i had a feeling it was too good to be true but i ended up thinking with my dick and didn't use any logic. 5-10 minutes past after we video called each other on messenger and she sends a screen recording of me. surprise surprise. i wanted to vomit, scream, faint, wake up from this horrible dream. she demanded $500 or else she'll share the video with my family, friends and university but i managed to negotiate down to $250. me being a broke student, $250 was my entire savings and i was willing to do anything to prevent this from escalating. she demanded it be sent via pay-pal or western union. here comes the worst part.

i couldn't because i was still in a state of shock and shame to set up my western union account or pay-pal account properly. it kept denying me access, so she said to send my details to her because she wanted the money now. and of course, completely overcome my irrational fear i agreed and ended up sending my address, email, debit card number and passport id. just writing this makes is really hard, i was just so desperate. a payment of $250 was sent this morning. 

couple hours later, i check my transaction so see that it's seeing in process, so i made the bold move to cancel the transaction. i hope this wont back-fire on me, enraging the scammer and giving a reason to upload my video as revenge. 

also, before i even got the chance to private everything, she already had all my friends copied down. which makes me think she will most likely share the video around if she doesn't get her money

since then, i've reported the sextortion to my government hotline and they managed to disable her facebook within 4 hours of my report. i've also deactivated all my social media and changed all my passwords and details. i've also requested a new bank card so fully intention to throw my old one out. i've also setup google alerts in case another pops up.  

right now all i'm doing is anxiously waiting, drowning in anxiety and fear. i'm reluctant to even post this cause what if she scrolls through reddit as well. i am so paranoid right now. is there anything else i should do? any sort of advice or closure is much appreciated."

"does anybody know if this is a scam? has anybody bought from the site en.ssfshop.com? i’m wondering if its a scam since there are many reviews and pictures and it seems pretty legit. however, i can’t find anything on the web to prove it is legit or a scam."
"is this a scam - grocery store cash withdrawal? i was at a grocery store today and paying for my groceries. total was $37. i put in my card to pay; machine flashed asking me if i wanted to donate to some charity. before i could select an answer the cashier thanked me for donating. whatever, i just wanted to get my groceries and go home. so then it asked if i wanted to withdraw cash. i was about to say ""no"" when the screen disappeared before i could select anything and the cashier gave me $20! i was confused af, i said ""did i withdraw cash?"" and he went ""i guess so"". is this a scam or just a glitch with the till? i know for a fact i didn't ask for cash back. i checked my bank account and there's no other charges besides the $57."

"n95 respirator website scam: modernbeyond my parents bought 10 n95 ($300 worth) respirators for the coronavirus for themselves and friends but the website ended up sending surgical cotton facemasks instead. a search from google showed that this company has a lot of 5 star and 1-2 star reviews.

https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/modernbeyond.com?rid=142

looks like they have a lot of fake reviews on sitejabber and a ton of 5 star fake reviews on their actual website.

here is the scam website: https://www.modernbeyond.com/

from the 1 star reviews on sitejabber it seems highly unlikely that my parents will ever see their money again. got to love people taking advantage of people, and putting those at risk when people think they are getting a product that will help them with this virus. amazing."
been wasting this refund scammer’s time for months. then he hits me with the activate these cards because they are $500 each. could i have just struck gold? i’m wondering what they gain from this scam.

"computer repair scam circa 2009 10 years or so ago, i got a random call on my landline from an indian microsoft ""tech support representative"" asking me if was aware of my computers ""bad"" performance. my computer was working okay but i was a naive 10 year old so went straight to my computer.

iirc he didnt ask for any personal info in regards to my isp, computer model, or location. he did not have remote access to my computer. he basically guided me through my computers control panel claiming to see the same things i see on his end. i ended up on a page that showed a list of dozens if not hundreds of notifications saying things like: program failed to launch, application error, task failed, etc. with a time and date stamp. i had no idea what i was looking but i did start to worry about my computer, which is what he wanted. 

he then said for two small payments of around $125 he could resolve the ""issue"". i told the man i'm only 10 years old and i would need to ask my father. he pushed for me to get his credit card and do it myself in exchange for a discount. i immediately hung up because it was too much pressure for me to handle and i knew something was not right. i played a lot of xbox 360 at the time and remember seeing notifications that microsoft/bungie would never ask for personal info, so it sort of clicked that it was a scam.

im not by any means a computer whiz but does anyone know the error meassges he showed me?"
"freelance animator here. fell for my first scam &gt;:( wishing i'd been less naive, but somehow i've survived 6 years as a freelance animator without getting scammed. how embarrassing.

it was a textbook check scam. this woman hired me to create an animation posing as a director and sent me a check, told me her producer ""accidentally"" sent me a check for like $1.5k more than i invoiced her and needed me to wire the $1.5k balance back or i'd be fired. i waited a few days for the money to show up in my account and sent the $1.5k.

lo and behold, even after the money went through the check got disputed as alter/fictitious and i now find myself out $1.5k.

luckily this person is a fucking idiot and made no efforts to cover her tracks. i know her many aliases, her family, her criminal record, all her phone numbers and every location that she's ever lived.

problem is, if she's that dumb, what does that make me? and my gf even warned me of how sketchy this job seemed. i feel like such an asshole.

i've called the attorney general, reported her to the fbi and her local cops. what else can be done short of traveling several states over and confronting her face-to-face?"

"gumtree scam with a tad of revenge so i’m selling an item on gumtree and someone sent a message asking for my email. i then receive an email asking a few questions about the item but they was really vague and didn’t really relate to the item i was selling.

this raised my suspicions but i answer the questions anyway. they then go on to ask if paying by paypal would be an issue, i have no issue with that and we press forward. 

(here comes the scam) “buyer” then states he will send me an extra £500 for shipping costs and i will need to pay the shipping company.

i say to the buyer straight away that i’ve never heard of a transaction taking place like this and i don’t see why they couldn’t just arrange and pay shipping like any normal person would and it sounds like a scam.

no answer.

bit gutted i didn’t have a sale i thought i would get some revenge.  now i know there’s no chance in hell i’m going to find out who this is so i played their game.

i emailed the buyer the following day saying i had spoke to a friend and he said it’s normal to pay for someone’s shipping on gumtree. i would like to go ahead with the sale.

buyer is back hook line and sinker. we’re back on. i had a feeling how the scam was going to go but i was curious how they was going to get the money into the account. surely they weren’t posting bank details and if so maybe they’re really dumb and this could link them to the crime. 

“payment has been made, you might need to check your junk mail” low and behold some moody, half arsed, shitty fake email from paypal was sitting in my junk mail. stating i’ve been paid £3700 inc their £500.

i then receive instructions on how to get payment to shipping officer. it basically says to go to currys, tesco, asda and buy a £500 steam wallet voucher lol.
now i purchased a game on steam less the 24 hours ago so i know exactly what steam is but i guess not everyone does. 

i tell the buyer i am on route to the shop. they pile a lot of pressure saying things like “you’re scamming me! you have taken my money and run etc”. i play along saying sorry i’m taking too long and i’m not scamming etc.

i then google steam vouchers and managed to find a code i can replicate. i changed the digits but made sure i had the same number of digits as the card i found google. i say to the scammer (why the fuck have i been calling them buyer) i don’t have a scanner and the camera on my phone doesn’t work and i’m unable to send picture of voucher. 

now they are getting excited, they pile more pressure and i’m receiving about 5 emails every ten mins from both the scammer and the pretend email. i play stupid and say it won’t send to paypal.co.uk. he then says i need to reply to confirmation email with the voucher code and i can just type the code because i don’t have scanner/phone. 

so i send “paypal” this fake voucher code and i get replies within 2 mins. scammer pushes for picture but i reply with same story, no camera/scanner. “paypal” replies saying they need a picture and i replay same story. 

then they start asking for the extra two digits on the end of voucher. i must of used an old code so less digits or image was from different country, i dunno. i apologised and gave him another two digits but he says it’s invalid still. the speed paypal was replying to the scammer and me i found pretty amusing, if only they did reply that quick. 

so now i’m getting an email a minute from both accounts now saying can i check the code, is it definitely a steam card etc. i say to him shall i call paypal and ask them what is going on? i was hoping this would cause them a bit a of concern. 

obviously he replies very quickly saying “as this transaction was done via e-mail payments service, so any inquiries and necessary information should be sent to paypal directly replying to this email (service-payteam@consultant.com) because the status of this transaction has not been passed on to their customer care phone service section. the voucher code you send to paypal is invalided can you please check the code again and resend it to them okay” this bullshit made me laugh tbh. 

after giving them another two digits they reply back minute later saying invalid code and can i use someone’s phone to take picture of voucher. now i’m bored and i let them have it. basically called them a dumb cu*t and a few other expletives and didn’t hear from them again.

i informed paypal and gumtree in the hope they may get caught but mostly so the accounts are closed. yeah they can make another one but it’s causes them agg i guess."
"bahamas vacation for 2 - harvardvacations.com a couple weeks ago i entered one of those mall giveaways for a bahamas vacation for 2. i got a text today with a picture of the entry (it is indeed the one i submitted and is in my handwriting). i replied, ""is this real?""

they responded, ""yes, this is real! you and a guest just got a free 5 day 4 night bahamas vacation for two. to make things simple for you, the gm put together a recording with all the details about your trip on it, so call our office at (phone number), press 7, then stay on the line and an agent will register your vacation in your name for you. i really hope you enjoy your vacation!""

i have not called the number yet, but i know these things typically make you pay fees. the entry does say that winners will still be responsible for all normal travel expenses, including transportation, resort/service fees and taxes. it says on the top of the entry, ""not a time share - names will not be sold."" on the bottom of the entry it says, ""licensed and bonded fla. seller of travel reg. no. st37536.

"covid-19 relief funds scams i wanted to share this information the it security officer at work sent to all employees today:

with all of the scams, phishing and other cyber-attacks being reported that are taking advantage of the covid-19 situation, i wanted to share a message from the ftc regarding the potential relief funds that would be sent to us citizens. the ftc states the following:

as the coronavirus takes a growing toll on people’s pocketbooks, there are reports that the government will soon be sending money by check or direct deposit to each of us. the details are still being worked out, but there are a few really important things to know, no matter what this looks like.

1. the government will not ask you to pay anything up front to get this money. no fees. no charges. no nothing.

2. the government will not call to ask for your social security number, bank account, or credit card number. anyone who does is a scammer.

3. these reports of checks aren’t yet a reality. anyone who tells you they can get you the money now is a scammer.

normally we’d wait to know what the payment plan looks like before we put out a message like this. but these aren’t normal times, and we predict that the scammers are gearing up to take advantage of this.

so, remember: no matter what this payment winds up being, only scammers will ask you to pay to get it. **if you spot one of these scams, please tell the federal trade commission:** [**www.ftc.gov/complaint**](http://www.ftc.gov/complaint)**.**"

"scam? involves huffpost, stack social, online courses. i saw an advertisement claiming that today, a computer science master class bundle had been discounted from nearly $3,000 to just $39 bucks. i thought ""coronapocalypse, anything can happen."" i got follow the link which brings me to huffpost ([link](https://www.huffpoststuff.com/sales/the-complete-computer-science-master-class-bundle?utm_source=huffpost.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-complete-computer-science-master-class-bundle&amp;utm_term=scsf-345967&amp;utm_content=a0x1p000004mqkx&amp;scsonar=1)). a near identical page is being held out at stack social ([link](https://stacksocial.com/sales/the-complete-computer-science-master-class-bundle)). i start smelling false advertising from here.

both websites boast 177 reviews and a five star overall rating. funny enough, on neither website can you click on or read the reviews. it's literally just images they put onto the page. false advertising?

on huffpost they acknowledge that the scratched out price of $2,799 is just a suggested retail price, translation it can mean anything. on stack social they don't even disclose that. so now i doubt they ever sold it at this price.

i can't see any demos of the course at all. i was close to buying and now feel mislead. anyone out there purchase these or similar courses from stack social / huffpost? is it a scam? even if it isn't, this must be misleading and manipulative advertising.

thanks - not sure if this will gain any traction as i'm sure there are bigger scam-fish to fry... but i'll lookout for feedback."
"getting all sorts of messages and calls on my phone number for someone who is not me. should i be worried? for a couple of months now i've been receiving a number of spam text messages for a person named durward (i also have his last name, but not including it here), who is definitely not me. today i received a call from a metlife consultant who was looking for this durward person at my phone number. i called him back and asked how he received my phone number and why it was tied to this durward person, and he said that it is tied to an account that he has been assigned and doesn't have any further info that he can provide.

part of me thinks this durward guy has just been fat-fingering my phone number for his, but i'm a bit worried that it's some sort of scam or identity theft. i've run credit reports and keep a good eye on my score and i don't see anything out of the ordinary. 

is there something i can be doing to stop this? i googled this guy's name and found a potential other phone number for him, but when i dialed it to try and talk with him, it said the number was disconnected."

i immediately hung up and blocked the number. i have no idea how she knows my name or the city i live in. i'm 14 and have never accessed an escort site. now i'm scared and wondering if i should have reported the number first. did i do the right thing?"
"anyone else getting the ""mylife"" extortion emails? i've gotten scammy things from these guys off and on over the past couple years, but always ignored it.

the latest version caught my attention: they falsely claim i have a criminal record and (hopefully falsely) claim they've shared this with 863 people.

yes, 863, an oddly precise number and probably 850 more people than have ever googled me in the history of google.

the body of the email explains that i can pay their ransom and they'll ""lock"" the record.

of course i have no intention of paying but wonder how widespread this is and what other people are getting.  searching didn't reveal much beyond their prior scams and class action lawsuits."

"sold a pair of shoes on ebay, he told me to text him because he has question. buyer has all positive reviews though... opinions? "
"hangouts  hello , i'm here to tell my little from last night and see what are your opinions , because i'm very anxious right now .
 well , it started last night , how i mentioned , on the french omegle because i wanted to develop my french (not doing it again) and here i found this girl (scammer) just typing something nasty in french and her/his gmail to add on hangouts . then , curious me  (stupid me) add her/him and talked a bit , asking about my age and my country (i'm a highschool teenager i don't want to give my age anymore) and she/he asked if we can do sex cam , first i hesitated but then because the hormona took control of my brain i accepted . she called me , the cam was laggy but really credible . at first i've only showed my pants and then my genita organ (masturbating a bit l and the she/he told me to show my face , again i hesitated , but i showed it for just 2-4 seconds . the ""girl"" on the cam stared to dance and took of her clothes then suddenly all stops getting messaged by him/her with the recording and some picks . 
  i was very  panicked , with hands trembling i refused to watch the messages that he was sending along with the pics ( from what i saw a bit , because i i refused to have any contact to the chat , he/she said something like he will post this ""sur le meilleurs sites"" - on the best sites , panic ) . i deleted the conversation and blocked and report the accounnt (the last message i saw i think it was something like ""you better start responding my mesaagea"" in french because i was watching at the mesages on the taskbar of my phone until that moment when i blocked the account ) 
  after all this , i was trembling i started making scenarios (i'm very anxious) and overthinking . then silence in my room , i was waiting to see if someting bad happens (even if i blocked the account i could see that he was stil active until like midnight or a bit late ) but nothing happened , i was waiting to see if i'll get any mesage via gmail , but nothing occured . (i want to mention that we talked only on hangouts , he/ she didn't demanded any social media accounts and i'm not 100% sure but i think he/she couldn't see my gmail on hangouts because i know google messaging apps are very strong on kepping personal information ) 
   next day (today) i was still a bit a panicked , still making scenarios , thinking that a person has pics with me ( my brain was hurting ) still nothing strange occured ( forgot to mention : i don't have friends on hangouts and other google apps , just on the major media apps that i'm using) . he / she was offline at that moment until afternoon when i decided to delete forever my gmail account ( lucky me : i have 2 gmails accounts and one yahoo account) saving the things i wanted , and moved to other account .
   until now , when i'm writing this whole message(19:46 pm in my country)  nothing strange had happened .
   i'm a bit calm now , but i'm still anxious on the  future he/she maybe still has the evidence and that makes feel very sad , i'm very nice guy in my life ,introverted  , i'm a good student at high school .
  now my two different opinions : 
      1. positive opinion : he has just the record and pics on me , and no other personal data (adress , ip , facebook , intagram etc. ) . and in this case i also think that he/she was just an amateur scammer .
      2.negative opinion : here i have this anxious scenario in which somehow that horrible pics arrive on the internet to people i know being totaly destroyed , i mention that he/she didn't demand any personal info or social media account .
    now i'm asking you what's your thought on this . am i safe ? does he hacked me somehow ? etc . many other question . please answer me , i want my mind to be free . thank you in advance !"
is this a scam? it seems to good to be true.

back again i think i found a scam trying to order a used transmission from american aircraft &amp; auto parts based in texas and owned by indians like most of the scrap yards. they’ve only been in business for two years and they’re website doesn’t exist (url not found). they contact me through email for a quote like a few companies did because of i entered my email in a website to get quotes from multiple places. they seem to be a real business they are on paper but only have one review on facebook saying they take your money and don’t deliver. is there a way to find out the legitimacy or somehow ensure a safe purchase. i assume all i can do is steer clear i’m just a simple car fixing fellow trying to get a transmission at a good price.
they're getting aggressive. received this text right after a phone call. is this new?

so i've had a suspicion that my friend was dealing with a pyramid scheme. all that talking about '*character*' and '*leadership*', i really thought he was getting into something legitimate. i found out everything he was doing (from reading books to taking in new ideas) was for the pyramid scheme in the end. books about *mentor*\-*ship*, *leadership*, *influencing* people, *personality* traits, *dreams* and *passion* and most dangerous of all, *the enslavement of the current system*, are reinforced constantly. he would tell me to read this and that. i thought it was great, personal development is respectable in itself, so i went along with it. he would always tell me how amazing this business was. how respectful everyone is. how nice they are. but now i see through that mask. they are all a bunch of scammers.

what is his business? he said, ^(""our business is amazing. all we need to do is recruit people. once we get more than 12 people under our name, we can gain a profit. we don't even need to work at our 9 to 5 job! this is financial freedom. while everyone is out working like a slave, we will be making money passively. it's a dream com true! everyone is so nice there. you should come to my business man. we have meetings every friday"") i think to myself, ""what about the people i recruited? how do they get money?"". isn't that a question worth considering? i didn't get to ask that question because he was so passionate in preaching his business. so then i asked him how much it costs he said, ^(""we only need to pay $400 a month. so if you can save up that much it would be good. also, a suit would be nice. in order to be rich, you gotta look rich. think rich. and then it will manifest in your life. you gotta be disciplined. no fapping, no junk food. strict diet. every morning, you need to have affirmations. it is important for success. but are you willing? are you willing to be committed to personal growth?"")

a clearly manipulative psychological tactic. it leaves you with not much options. if you say you aren't committed to personal growth, then you are looked down upon. a natural hierarchy follows the interaction. you are at the bottom. a moral superiority complex arises; personal growth is smart, if you are not willing then you are weak and dumb... and become looked down upon. interactions are dull. those books are coming to work, i'll give him that. subtle manipulation and attack on my character. very persuasive, but disgusting and i see that mask. i then ask further questions about this 'business'. he then goes, ""the focus is on learning how to build a cash-flow asset for financing, financial independence, and leadership skills. you can become financially independent if you can work hard. it is all about work ethic. you have to begin somewhere and take action. one small step. that is when the rewards come. my life has drastically changed for the better and i wouldn't be here without my team. i plan to retire in my early 30's. being involved with this business can make that possible without a doubt.""

see what i mean by preaching? it is very persuasive and gets the attention of innocent. obviously he is completely oblivious to the impending effects of a pyramid scheme. he is not that stupid, i think to myself. how is he falling for this? desperateness? no... maybe it is something deeper. i assume the schemes have upgraded in terms of ideology and belief system. they are preying on the weak and desperate; granting them the secret knowledge of success. my friend is now calling himself an entrepreneur. i never knew you can be an entrepreneur without owning a business. i could be wrong.

^(""we coach and mentor you on all the things you want to know and you can get a 3-5 year plan to allow you to do as you please. our business is a win-win situation. here's why. we gain profit if you succeed. that is the only way for us to benefit. if you can't succeed, then we can't succeed. isn't that amazing? so our business is naturally people-oriented and our purpose is to help others succeed in all areas of life."" (at a lovely price of $400 a month, sir))

yuck. so that's how low these schemes have come. you know, i would not be this frustrated if it weren't preying on the innocent minds. they are influencing their beliefs and ideology at a psychological level. ingrained deep inside, almost brain-washing. to create the perfect slave for the business. they talk about the enslavement of 9 to 5, but they do not realise they are slaves themselves. depriving the people on the bottom any profit, is what he is essentially doing. it is a disgusting business model, and he is very passionate about it. this scam will not last long, it's downfall is inevitable and calculable. it is only a matter of time."
"""urgent information"" emails i've been emailed this 3 times on my throwaway email, the weird thing is this time they changed the email to say why i haven't responded, the email goes

"is this website (https://premiumkeystore.com/) a scam? it is listed as an ''official reseller'' on the keep2share filehosting websites that resells keys (since keep2share themselves don't offer paypal options). 

this website offers paypal payments but there is no process pending after i tried to purchase one but they did send me an order receipt with a ''pending payment!''. the order itself didn't even succesfully redirect me to paypal (got error message). i'm beginning to be legit worried that it's all a scam or if it's just a crapsite that fucks up."
"is this a scam or am i an idiot? hi, you guys i need to know if this is a scam or not.

so, bascially here's a bit of backstory. i am a female high school graduate who is 19 years old, &amp; still living with their mom trying to gain a job or a income somehow and been trying to look for a job since, i've graduated from high school in may of 2019. i've been struggling, and struggling. so, i decided to take a different route and looked for some no experience jobs that was relating to customer support (since, i'm strong in that area considering, i've been support and administrator for many discord bot support guilds) and, ofc one day, i felt like i was so suddenly lucky, when i was messaged via by phone number by someone by the name of: louise ******

i was told to be interviewed by her via google hangouts about the job @ walgreens. so, i told her my gmail and she gave me her gmail which was louisealfredzx@gmail.com (and, before you say anything the reason why i show her gmail is because, im looking to see if anyone else knows this person and, if this person is really out here a scammer because usually, i be hearing that any person with a yknow for example some *insert site here*.com in their names but this one didn't so i was a bit conflicted.)

so, she asked the questions which was: 
1. what type of jobs have you had?
2. how did you get your previous jobs?
3. what were your main responsibilities?
4. are you currently employed?
5. are you willing to work flexible or long hours?
6. do you have a printer, copier, fax, and scanner?
7. what are your career goals ( both short-term and long term ) ?
8. how confident are you?
9. what steps do you take when you have to make an immediate decision and you do not feel you have all the relevant or necessary information?
10. are you seeking for a part-time or a full-time position?
11. how would you like to be paid? weekly or bi-weekly. direct deposit or check?
12. what financial institution do you operate with to see if it tallies with the company's official salary payment account to employees?
13. do you always double-check your work?
14. what work have you done that involved working with sensitive or confidential issues...?

and, of course, i answered them and eventually, within a day or so i was accepted on the spot and i was excited because i literally was in desperate need of a job. then, after i few tasks i had to do they, said that they will send me a check for me to use to buy the material needed for the job since, i would not be allowed to use my own &amp; told me that as soon as i get it to deposit so a day or so they sent me a check of $4,599.00 then, i was told to inform them if i received it and when it came i did. 

they told me to deposit it and i did via mobile banking because i found it to be much easier rather than having to go all way towards the bank and which of course there was only a limit for me to add. which was $2,500.00 so i was like hecc, and deposited only that amount and tried to deposit the rest but failed. 

i told her, and she said usually i was supposed to go to the bank to deposit it but, told her i thought it would be much easier to do it via mobile banking and such but, regardless i showed her how much was deposited to go in (dw i'm not that dumb i didn't show her my account number just screenshotted the part where it was placed on hold.) she said she understood and informed the company to send in the materials to me themselves considering, the whole situation that went down and to give her a moment regarding it. so, i said ok and to tyt and she came back saying they will cover it and, that i should receive the materials soon or so, so then i can start training and she said, that of course in order to start tracking my training and overall, hours spent on me doing my job she mentioned something called a: g1 time tracker machine.

at this point, i started to get a weird feeling about this. she proceeded to say that she needed two $100 google play cards in order, to activate this. i was like so confused so i went to go google it when she said that and then, boom when i searched this ""g1 time tracker machine"" thing. i found out it's a scam, that someone else also got scammed by here: https://community.upwork.com/t5/freelancers/new-scam-through-odesk/td-p/5849

so at this point, i decided i wanted to just confront her about it and then, block her but, i also felt like i don't want to assume the worse about things or jump to any conclusions yet with that, i also started to think about the $4k i deposited. the thing is, half of the check has been deposited completely but then, there was a bank adjustment and now, the full $4k is being deposited on hold. so, i have two questions:

is the money legit i deposited legit? (if so, it would be good to be leaving this scammy person with $4k in my bank enough to help me and my bro out. and, its stated that the money will be for use on the 26th of this month) and, is this a scam for real or am i complete idiot and i'm not overreacting."

"my friend posting this all over her facebook. social security scam, with a twist. and they refer to you by name, making it sound more legit. even she went to social security's website. they actually tell you to call them on the number she listed attention residents: i just received a very threatening phone call claiming to be from social security. they claimed my social security number had been compromised, and they will suspend all payments, benifits, and anything related to my social security information, including bank accounts, irs payments, etc, etc. they told me that failing to cooperate with them is an admission of guilt, and a warrant will be placed for my arrest. they were very threatening, insistent, and demanding. the call the number came from is 1-833-781-3152

please be aware: social security will never call you over something of this nature. ever. and cannot, will not, ever suspend your information or account. social security is aware of this scam, and i reported the phone number and information to them as well. my caller id did show social security administration as the caller. that is just simple, spoofing software. the call is not from social security. please keep our seniors and disabled safe and pass on the information. they are very threatening, and even i questioned myself, lol.

i found the ad of girl on a [bedpage](https://bedpage.com) offering a massage services. it has a number and i texted her.

she said i'm in a hotel such and such come see me, and when i'm there to let her know. when i'm at the hotel, she said she needs a 100$ deposit beforehand, i said not gonna happen i can send you $20 bucks, see picture below.

"service of process / lawsuit scam i just got a phone call from a girl claiming to be from my local clerk's office claiming that someone was trying to sue my mother but have been unable to properly serve her with the complaint and therefore were serving me as i am her ""sub-recipient"" and provided me with an incomplete case number and the phone number of t he ""law firm"" in which the lawsuit was coming from. i'm an attorney by trade, so naturally all of this made no sense to me. i had a feeling it was a scam, but wanted to double check and make sure my mom wasn't actually being sued. i went online and used a spoofed phone number to call said ""law firm"".

the phone number they provided was (888) 320-\*\*\*\*. when i called some guy answered the phone and said ""hudson legal services, how may i help you."" i informed him that i was told they were suing me, but that their ""process server"" gave me an incomplete case number. he asked for my information and i told him ""honestly, i don't really know if this is a scam or not. so before i do anything else, i'm just going to see what i can find on my own."" he said that was fine and if i had any more questions, to call him back with my case number. i waited a few min then promptly called back again, this time with another spoofed number. this time he answered with a different law firm name, to which i responded  ""i thought this was hudson legal services?"" he replied ""it is!"" so i said ""but you just said a different name, not hudson legal services"" and i have to give credit where credit is due, but he got me  with a real zinger here and said ""no i didn't!"" i apologized and asked him for address to which he stated he did not feel comfortable providing me with the address then became angry and stated ""can you tell me why you're inquiring about my whereabouts?"" i told him i was called by a process server and told that his firm was suing me  and that i wanted to go and personally pick up my said process papers, as i was never properly served. at this point, he asked me for my bar # and i said ""you first."" i waited a few more min and thought i'd call one last time, just to really piss him off and surprise, surprise, the number was no longer working.

"biggest student aid scam i hope this reaches out to as many individuals as possible. this is truly the biggest student loan scam that is currently in operation. having existed for over 5 years, this large group of call center scams that operates in colombia (south america) has collected millions of dollars in illegal fees, by promising individuals in debt that provided they pay an upfront fee they would qualify to get their student loans written off or “forgiven” by the federal government. they then trade and sell peoples social security numbers, credit card/banking information, even credentials to sensitive information regarding a persons federal aid account. (a fafsa account holds an individuals contact information, address, social security number, date of birth). this is a process they call “recycling leads”

this company has changed names, register under different llcs, changed location and they operate under many different names and use many different phone numbers to avoid detection. this call center scam claims to be affiliated with the department of education and most of the representatives are ex convicts who were deported to colombia (south america) shortly after serving their sentence in the us. 
 
they mostly target the elderly, threatening people of ages 60-80 + (often times under a permanent disability) or anyone with a student loan debt and that if they don’t comply to give out their banking/ credit card information to pay for an upfront fee to “get their student loans forgiven” they would be garnished on their social security income and penalized by the federal government. the type of demographics this company targets are vulnerable as most of them rely solely on their social security income or welfare to cover their most basic needs.

how is this possible? while you are on the phone with a representative, shortly after asking you personal questions about your income they will require you to reset your fafsa (a free online account the federal aid office gives you when you take out a loan) by sending you a code to the email or phone # that is registered under your fafsa account to immediately reset and change your password without you even noticing. granted access to a persons fafsa they now have access to an individuals social security number, date of birth, student loan account, address and contact information. with this they make it seem like they already had your information and often times make it look like they are affiliated with the department of education. they use this to intimidate people and force them to pay for their service fee. sometimes they cant even access a persons fafsa and still use intimidation and predatory tactics to get a persons credit card/banking information under the promise that is needed to pay for a fee “in order to get your loans forgiven” or to get them out of default status.

there are many, many companies that are part of this very same conglomerate of scams. they promise people with student loans that if they pay an upfront fee their loans would qualify for student loan forgiveness. they then trade and sell peoples information, social security numbers, credit card/ banking information, date of birth and contact info to other companies of the same kind; even those individuals who chose not to pay for the “student loan forgiveness” service fee.they hold hundreds of thousands of peoples personal information in their records. remember, once they have access to your fafsa they own all your personal/sensitive information."

"realitymine/realitymeter legit? i usually do surveys from ipsos for some points and the other day i got notified that i can get some points for using realitymine/realitymeter. from what i can tell it's an app/vpn that just wants to be in the background to see my online behavior (to sell my purchase journies to marketing companies basically)

i've heard about amazon letting people keep packages, but isn't that tricky from a legal standpoint, since it's probably stolen goods, technically?

"costfriendlycosmetics ??? hi,

i got an email from a place called costfriendlycosmetics with an apparent email address of &lt;ship@pirateship.com&gt;.    the email is titled ""your shipment is on its way!"" and the message reads:

""we wanted to let you know that your package will ship on 03/18/20 via first class package. you can track your package at any time using the link below.  
   
 please allow up to 24 hours for the tracking link to update.""

it then goes on to list my address that it is shipping to and gives a tracking number that i can click upon. it closes with ""if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reply to this email.""

the problem is i've never heard of this place and don't know what this could possibly be. i haven't replied and don't plan on clicking the tracking link. i searched this ""costfriendlycosmetics"" online and a few things come up that don't really verify that this is any kind of real company. 

does anyone know anything about this or suspect what may be going on?

thanks"

they barely speak english, they take back the account you bought for after a certain amount of time and they can't help you with it since their refund policy is crap. they can't deal with the original seller that (with proof) took back their account after giving it to me. and they are a bunch of liars. &lt;3

"i got scammed for $500 not exactly craigslist but similar. u/redit-rud3 messaged me on march 16th, 2020 about computer parts that he wanted to sell me. it seemed like a good deal and he was able to send conformational pictures that he actually had them. i went through with the purchase ($200 on apple pay and $300 on zelle because apple pay wasn’t working) only to find today that he wasn’t responding. after texting him all day finally i got a response saying he didn’t know who i was and he got the phone number this morning. the weird texting mannerisms that this guy had were evident still in the “second guy” like saying two words on different lines but in the same bubble. 

i collected all the information i could on this guy like his full name, age, and last known address. 

nevertheless i’m out $500 and don’t know what to do and could use some real help. i know that i’m an idiot for this and it’s really embarrassing."

"airbnb refuses to help even though guest causes upwards of $50,000 worth of damage!!  

we had a guest stay at our house for 1 night and the next morning our cleaners came in and called us to inform us that the guests had completely destroyed the home. the majority of the furniture is broken, the hvacs in the backyard were broken, there are holes in the wall, the original wood floors (100 year old) are completely ruined, all the carpeting needs to be replaced due to urine and mens ejaculate on the floor in the bedrooms. through business cards found at the house we were able to locate people that were at the house that night and recorded their instagram stories showing about 200 people going absolutely wild in our house. standing on all the furniture, smoking, and destroying our home. we have collected over 20min worth of footage from people that were storying on instagram that night. we called airbnb immediately and at first we thought we were going to be ok based on what the case manager told us. then a day later once we started to submit invoices from contractors, hvac company, and cleaners, we started getting the run around. case managers kept getting switched and they would no longer call us or speak on the phone and wanted to only handle the case via email. this is an extremely complicated and extensive case that needs more than an email reply once a day. this is our home. we are currently homeless sleeping at friends couches because our home is so utterly destroyed and disgusting that we cant enter it without gloves and masks. we don't have even close to the amount of money needed to bring our home back to a livable state. shame on you airbnb! the world will know of your wickedness."

"i got a job offer and i'm not sure if it is a scam or not and need some help determining if it is i was contacted a few days ago by a company saying they saw my resume on indeed and were interested in offering me a position at the company. the company is a proclaimed mail forwarding company to process mail/packages/documents for virtual offices or companies based outside the us. this is a work from home position. i had never heard of them but they have a very legitimate, very well designed website with contact numbers, job openings for various positions, about us page etc etc. not a single thing about the site looks suspicious. important note: all communication i've had with them has been through email and their hr department link for employees.

after a day or so of talking, i was offered the position along with what my salary would be. i filled out the employment papers, proved i'm legal to work in the us, proved i'm a resident etc etc. all typical, cut and paste job stuff. fast forward to this morning and the hiring manager tells me of my first assignment. due tomorrow morning, they're going to deposit over $5000 into my bank account. from there, i have to withdraw it in cash then wire it to somebody via moneygram (they are including money to cover the gram fees as well). i'm unsure if it's a client of the company or someone who helped the company but the manger told me it's to cover the cost of some software that either this person made for the company or to someone to make them this software. 

this obviously sounded insanely suspicious to me but i dug around *a lot* about them and it seems very legitimate. i found out that it's a child company of a larger company and it's officially registered to my state as a business. it's new (been around for only 2 years or so) and therefore has nothing on the bbb although it comes up as a valid llc on the bbb. 

the issue i'm having here is that transferring money like that feels very sketchy for 2 reasons. a: they just trusted me out of nowhere to handle thousands of dollars and b: moneygram has a limit of $3,000 (to my knowledge). it all sounds very strange and very bizarre. but at the same time, they haven't asked for a penny of my money. nowhere did anyone mention at any time that i had to pay some sort of fee or anything like that. if anything, i'm the risk since this money is going to me. they also said that if i have paypal then i can use that instead since it's easier. 

i have no idea how to feel about this or whether or not i should just bail now while i have a chance. i've recorded every single interaction i've had with them and saved them along with saving every email they have sent me should anything come up in the future for whatever reason. i have my fingers crossed that it's genuine but i just can't shake the feeling that something is up with it."

(uk) so today, a friend of mine mentioned that his father in law was looking for someone who owned a property, he said that if i was interested, his father in law would pay my council tax bill for a year if i could give him a tenancy agreement that said he was renting at my property, he assured me he would not send any letters to my address and was not looking to stay at my address but just needed a tenancy agreement 

i refused but it made me wonder what he was up to, what could he do with a tenancy agreement at my address and why would he just not use his own address as he is already renting a flat somewhere else

a council tax bill is around £1400 for a year so he was willing to part with alot of money for it, but seemed too good to be true although i can't out my finger on what his end goal was"

"received a netflix ""finish setting up your account"" email, but have no netflix account i received a netflix email saying to finish setting up your account. i don't have a netflix subscription so i checked the sender. it's legit. i checked my bank statement and found nothing odd. 

i then called netflix's customer service number
to see if they had my email, explaining the situation. after 30 minutes of waiting and hearing netflix theme songs, i got someone. he looked up my email address and said that it looked like someone typed in the wrong address when trying to log in. he told me to hit the unsubscribe button and then check the box saying to no longer receive emails. i should receive an email stating the change and would receive no further emails.

well, now i feel like an idiot because i hit unsubscribe, it brought me to netflix (or what i assume was netflix) communication settings. it showed my email and had an option choosing not to receive any further emails. i hit update, but nothing happened. it showed a circle spinning and immediately just showed ""update"" again. i couldn't unclick the checkbox either. i received no email. so i just closed out.

here i am now. by this point i feel like a total idiot and questioning reality and am wondering if i somehow got scammed and called the wrong number, but it's the legit netflix number. the site looks like netflix. did i mess up by clicking that unsubscribe button? i'm trying not to panic. i don't usually fall for these at all, but i'm afraid that i did today. does anyone else have this problem?"

"beware of job scammers hello everyone, 

i don't really post much on reddit however recently i was scammed from a fake job posting. i wanted to share this with everyone since i realized many more people could fall into this. 

i was recently let go from a job and was desperate to find anything. i went ahead and asked close friends if they knew of any jobs around and that's when an old co worker of mine redirected me to this job scam and assured me he's worked with this ""man"" for several years. 

i went ahead and attached this just so you guys can see how these scammers work.  [here is the link.](https://imgur.com/nmzd1fz)

this is just one of the many emails i received.  the scammer showed me his fake ""company"" website, he boasted about his credentials and even sent me his personal cellphone number so i could contact him whenever.

he spoke perfect english since i did a small phone interview with him and assured me he was no scammer, he was just looking for ""honest hard workers.""

me being desperate, i accepted to ""work"" for him. i did a week of work for him, like emailing him expense reports, setting up events etc. 

i received a check from fedex a week later of $2,000 and stupidly deposited the check. bank calls days later and turns out i've been scammed.  i have some pictures of texts and emails he sent me if you guys want to see more. i understand there were many, many red flags in the email but i was running out of money and was stupidly desperate."

"instagram brand ""seedkiss"" is a scam i literally made a reddit account just so i could post about this and let people know...there is a brand that mainly just advertises on instagram called ""seedkiss"". i kept seeing their brand in my feed and the clothes were really cute so i decided to go to their website. their clothes looked really cute, mainly current trends and the pictures didn't look too dodgy. also, their clothes were really cheap, similar ones in urban outfitters would be about triple the price they were offering. so, i decided to go full send and order 5 dresses/rompers, totaling almost $172. i ordered these clothes on january 28, 2020. i ordered express shipping, which said on their website would take 5-8 business days, which was kinda long for express shipping, but i was excited so i did it anyway. they sent me a confirmation email saying my order was confirmed, and they would soon send me another email when my order had shipped. spoiler alert, i never received that email. it is now march 17th, and i have never received these clothes. since i hadn't gotten a tracking code (since it never even shipped), i had to go through all kinds of hoops on their website to try and track it, to which it said the order was 'being prepared'. i have tried many, many times to contact their customer service to ask where my order is or just for a refund, and every time i type my complaint and press 'submit ticket', it will not let me and says ""verification code invalidation"". no matter what i do. i think this is all part of the scam, and they purposely created a bug in that there is absolutely no way to contact them, because no one is receiving orders. however, i should also add that on the page to contact them, they say, ""dear customer, we are sorry to inform you that the delivery time will increase due to the current public holidays in china, where the majority of our suppliers are located. please expect additional time for us to fulfill your order if you place your order after january 21st, 2020. we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. your patience is highly appreciated."" now i would accept this for a couple weeks maybe, but not 2 months. 2 months is unacceptable to say when it hasn't even shipped, and i can't even contact them. other companies who outsource from china seemed to have no problem still shipping out their products from there. so, long story short, i'm now out $172 and there is absolutely nothing i can do about it. heads up, do not order from this company unless you want to give your name, phone number, credit card number, and address to god knows who, and waste a shit ton of money. also, i'll include a screenshot of the email for my order confirmation, and you can easily look on their website for their excuse for delayed shipping, and i would love it if someone else would try and contact them and see if it works, i would love to be wrong. just wanna look out for my fellow consumers!

"couple tried to scam, accused me of “hit and run”. as if the pandemic going on isn’t scary and crazy enough.. i had to pick up some masks from my mom in my old hometown yesterday. i was on the freeway exit.. there were 2 left lanes to turn left. i wanted to get on the right one.. looked both to my right and behind me to check if there were any incoming cars. none. so i went for it. as i was going, all of a sudden, a car drove up and was besides me. seeing that, i immediately braked. i was looking for their reaction, if they were going to let me get in the lane or not. they did and even went to the lane next to it, so i took it as a a-okay. so there i am, driving, took a right onto a more quiet street.. after awhile, i noticed the car behind me had been following me. i get a little scared and took a detour so they wouldn’t follow me to my mom’s house. i kid you not, this car was on a open street... swerving and trying to block the road. right there and then, i added 2 and 2 together, it was the car from the freeway exit. so i tried to drive past them and went to a stop light. i’m waiting to turn left and they park right in the middle of the street, the man got out (with his “wife(?)” in the driver’s seat. he started yelling and saying “you hit our car, it’s not big but pull over. you keep running from us”. so i went to pull over.. and keep in mind, if some random car was acting super weird like that... i think anyone would’ve been scared. i was alone too. i’m a 5 ft tall, 96 pound female. anyways, i pull over, the guy comes to my passenger side window and says “you hit my car blah blah blah”. he checks my car for damages and sees some old scratches i’ve had on my car for about 2 years, claims it’s from the “hit and run”. i tell him “if i had hit your car, i would have stopped somewhere. i would have felt and heard it”. then he proceeds to say “if you don’t want to pay us anything, that’s fine. we already reported this hit and run to the highway patrol”. then he let me leave.

i found this odd. i’ve never been in a car accident and knew from other friends that normally you exchange details, call the cops to the scene. 

when i got home, i called my car insurance to notify them of it. and they suggested i call highway patrol if i wanted to get a peace of mind. i did.. and guess what? they said nobody reported a hit and run on the freeway i was getting of on. he even said it sounded like the couple was just trying to get money from me. 

what is wrong with people????"

"sugar mummy twitter scam i know that the scammer i’m going to talk about isn’t a call scammer but i really need help getting my money back. so here’s the story.
today i was looking through twitter and saw that i got a new follower and she the she was a sugar mummy and that she was giving away some of her money, i thought to myself that i really needed the money because of personal reasons. she told me that i had to pay a fee of $20usd to get the money i asked for. i payed it through paypal. then she said that she needed another $20usd again, and me being very naive i payed it again. again she asked me to do it, so i did. she asked me to pay again but i did not have the money to do so. she kept on trying to persuade me to pay but i couldn’t pay. i then asked for a refund and she replied with “wyd baby” i then repeatedly asked for my money back and called her a scammer. she blocked me. i have requested a refund for my money back. i’m so upset with myself for falling for one of those twitter scams. and i’m seeking advice on what i should do to prevent this happening again. i shouldn’t have been so naive. her twitter @ is @sugarmo09187642 . any advice would be greatly appreciated. i can’t get in contact with her anymore as she has blocked me"

"my company has outsources the promotion of its fb page, but we have been scammed. they bought fake likes. how to prove it? hello there.

we own a fb page for a small city in japan. 

we outsourced its promotion because my coworkers don't know how social media promotion works so they thought it was safest to ask someone else to do it. 

a friend of my director introduced her friends' company, they are specialized in facebook promotion. they directly were talking about the big numbers of their previous promotion campaigns and i found that fishy. but my director was so hyped about it and didn't hear my concerns.

he paid a lot of cash for getting our fb page promoted abroad, one post every week for 4 months. when i say a lot, it's a lot (a number with four zeros -in $). 

but it turned out i was the one in charge with the writing of the posts and the translation (i'm not a native english speaker and not very confident in my english writing skills, though i had to write 20 pieces of article in both french and english). so i was a bit surprised to hear that i had to write the articles considering the bi amount of money that had been put on the table. i expected that for that amount of money we'd have a native journalist writing quality contents about us. ok, it's been years i'm living here, i probably know the city better than any journalist, i can understand why they ask me such a thing. 

they uploaded 5 pieces of article with a somewhat relative punctuality (the first 3 posts were posted every week as promised, but for the next 3 weeks there were no articles published. it's only when i made the remark they uploaded two in a row). 

they boosted the posts, which is what i expected. our posts hit massive reaches and had lots of comments every time. most of the time, it was comments from people in india, malaysia, philippines, countries in asia even though we wanted to target europe. some comments were fishy, as for example accounts of naked ladies leaving random heart stickers as a comment, asian men posting ad pictures for websites such as "".....com , rise your followers and likes instantly"", etc. etc. 

we quickly reached 10k followers and likes on our page. after that, no post was uploaded, no post was boosted anymore. 

they said it's because they reached their goals of 10k followers and that they won't be doing any more. i was infuriating, we don't need numbers. we need visibility. we need people to know about us. i don't care about your numbers. 

if i only wanted numbers i could buy the 10k on an indian website myself for like 100$.

now i am trying to prove my director we have been scammed and that those 10k are fake. he seems to still trust them. i need solid proof to make him realize he spent loads of money in the air. 

so i tried posting a few posts without boosting them. i reached an average of 600 persons and had 30 likes. i showed him the numbers, tried to explain him that if our 10k followers were legit we should be interesting more people than that, but the scam company told him it's normal. 

i need proofs. i need something solid to make my coworkers open the eyes on the situation. do you have any hint on what i can do? are there people specialized in spotting fake facebook pages and making detailed reports? i'd be ready to hire one with my own money.

please help me"

email said i had suspicious looking activity on my account (i had been using paypal a lot as of late) 

i clicked a link to a legitimate looking paypal website and logged into my paypal account and that's about it.

i realized about 5 minutes later that the email wasn't from paypal at all so i changed my password and deleted my external cards off the account.

"tinder scam- what can they do? genuinely concerned here. i matched with a girl on tinder who seemed real enough- multiple profile pics, typical college-aged edgy bio, not perfect english but not too broken and the girl looked foreign so i didn’t think anything of it. about 10 messages in she asks for my number so i give it to her. immediately after, she unmatches me. i get a text about 10 minutes later from a number claiming to be her. from the first text it’s an obvious scam- super broken english, pleads to meet up, only in town for one night, etc. so i reply “wrong number.” the texter then ignores that and replies again pleading to hook up. i reply with the skull emojis because i’m dying at how bad of an attempt this is. the freaky part comes next.

the texter replies “wellllll i’m just watching southpark *more attempts to meet in person*.” i was watching southpark at that exact moment, on a hulu account that’s under my brother’s information, on my own smart tv. i basically responded that this was an embarrassing scam and threatened to report them and i haven’t heard anything since (24 minutes).

i don’t have any personal info on my tinder besides my first name and the college i graduated from. how did they find out what i was watching on hulu? how screwed am i and what measures should i be taking?"
"have i been scammed? my cousin was offered a job as a staffing coordinator for pinnacle living management and she declined and sent them my information.the job is an at home position and sounded great to me since i'm pregnant. they offered me the position after i did a written interview and application. i signed an employee agreement with a header and stamp from the ceo. they told me they would send me 2960 dollars for my work laptop. they sent it to me via check through email and it looked official i even verified with the bank. i deposited it into my account. they said 700 was for me for my first week of training and the rest 2260 needed to be deposited into an account with chase bank, they gave me the account name number and routing and address. asked me to send them a picture of the receipt and once i did asked me to tear it into 4 pieces and send a picture. they sent me 10 lengthy chapters to study and said i had 10 days to do and take a test. 

today i got a notice from my bank stating the check for 2960.00 was taken back out due to ""alter/fictitious"" i called my bank and they stated i needed to get in touch with my employer. i'm waiting to hear back now. is it a normal thing for scammers to give me a fake check but deposit most of that into another account for them to get it back as real currency or am i just worrying to much too soon? thanks in advance for any advice about this.."
"this is bizarre. how could they have gotten this information? my grandma called me this morning asking if i was alright. apparently someone posing as me called asking for $4,000. he said that i was driving a friend's car while drunk and got into an accident at an intersection. in the supposed accident, he said i broke my nose which is why his voice didn't match mine. my grandma was worried and was about to send the money via a wire transfer. she decided to  hang up and call me to see if i was alright. after we both realized it was a scam, she told me she was expecting a follow-up call from a ""lawyer"". the man called from another number in the same region and she told him that i was fine which is when he hung up.

the bizarre part of the story is that they knew many things about me. they knew that i was her oldest grandson. they also knew which college i go to. the premise of the scam was that i was on spring break in indianapolis (the area codes that called her matched) with some friends from my school. i actually was on spring break last week but in a much warmer location lol.

how could they have known this? my grandmother and i have different last names and her area code doesn't even match my school's area code. after telling this story to some friends someone suggested that it could possibly be from a family tree on [ancestry.com](https://ancestry.com). i am very into family history so i made a large tree for both sides of my family, but i believe that the site's policy is that living ancestors are completely private. i suppose it's possible they could have matched her name to her phone number if they were able to hack my family tree. they could have then googled my name and then found my school due to social media profiles. does this sound possible and is there any other ways they could have made this connection? i'm a little freaked out. thanks."

then offers very high paying on,one procurement position. not sure how the scam goes from there, bailed out at that point.

tinder, long conversations then before meeting wants a romance identity license from another site.
the more obvious ones on tinder have an email or web page written in their photos. i run out of reporting swipes faster than the other swipes.

hinge matches then switches to email, long story story dad died young, raised by single mum, half american half australian. buys and sells antiques.

immediately, i was worried. although i trust my friend, i am worried that he got scammed into sending that message to me. all the time, i hear about scams like this. however, i don't have the knowledge to know if it's even possible to scam in this way. i've also heard that this could give solicitors active phone numbers(which i have enough of anyway). so, here are my questions:

for only $50 and transferring it to ""domain registry"" they will renew it until june of 2021.

you read it here first! this generous company will take my $50 and my domain name and give me **exactly nothing**.

gotta say, i'm impressed."

"a guy tried to scam me and got extremely mad when he failed i was selling an ingame item,this person messaged me showing interest in that,he started at 450€,i quickly told them the price i am looking for is 1.250€,they tried to bargain for 600€ nothing happened,later the next day they message me saying they really want my item and i should tell them my price,i still said the same price but we bargained for a while and ended up going for 1.000€.they asked for my [paypal.me](https://paypal.me) instead of my email even tho i just gave them my email adress but they insistet of me giving them my [paypal.me](https://paypal.me), anyways didn't think anything of that and did it,few mins later they say that the money is sent.i check my paypal,nothing,check my email also nothing.i tell them that i have not received anything,few minutes go by and they sent me a screenshot which looked really believable and couldnt be seen as fake unless you checked on the transaction number which i could not at that time it was around 1am for me in all the years of using paypal i never had a payment not show up in my email. so i didn't trust them with that, told them i will not give them the item unless the payment is confirmed into my account.they lost it at that moment,literally turned from ''nice and friendly'' to the biggest asshole i've met so far,throwing tantrums at me,accusing me of fraud,scamming, that they will block my paypal and get me into legal trouble,that i am a liar,retard,fucktard,bitch etc any possible cuss word you can imagine at a span of 2hours of a conversation,and that only cause i was not giving them the item unless i get my money,they tried to get me to give in and trust them but i did not.i thankfully trusted paypal more than i would trust this random person and contacted them the next day,came out the transaction never happened and it was just an edited picture.guys never,ever trust anybody who says they have sent you money on your paypal but you see no confirmation on your mail nor anything in your balance.it's 100% a scam."

"alleged 'hacker' website offering money. scam? i came upon [this](https://kloviactools.net/cash-app-server-flip/) website called kloviac tools. they promote the idea of ""exchange servers"" and ""flip tools"" with either cashapp, paypal or western union deposits. **they ask for your name, paypal email, amount of money you'd like to receive, country and phone number.** 

after i emailed them with some questions, they followed up with this response - 

*""hello, welcome to kloviac tools (a group of skilled hackers dedicated to using our skills to give you a better life). here at kloviac tools, we ensure the safety of all our clients by using exchange debug logs to perform hacks. however, we use series of exchange logs and codecs to process a series of transfers to our exchangers who then relay the funds to you to ensure your financial safety. the result is that you receive clean and safe funds. the transfer takes minimum of 45 minutes to maximum of 6 hours (depending on the amount applied for) after confirming payment.""*

"thanks for the warnings! we recently sold a car privately. last time we did this was in the 1990's so we were wary but went ahead and posted it online. i was browsing and came upon this sub, and read through just a few postings. 

then i told my husband who was handling the emails and calls. we were hit with 2 scams the first day and a third. thanks to this community, we avoided all the traps! would we have figured them out on our own? perhaps, but it was so much easier when i told my husband a scam, and then it showed up. it saved us a lot of stress and possibly a lot of money!

the car sold, for a good but fair price.

the scams:

1. by phone: i'll send a code to verify you are a real person. read it back to me. - they are trying to get into an account that requires two factor authentication. 
2. email: i'll send a certified or cashier's check and have the car picked up next week. - the check will clear and the money be deposited in our account. then the bank will determine the check is fraudulent and require we return the money, and the vehicle is gone. here's a good explaination [https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/certified-check-vs-cashiers-check-which-safer/](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/certified-check-vs-cashiers-check-which-safer/) this is particularly tricky because all our financial smart friends were totally shocked by this scam. my husband was already suspicious because the person was buying the car sight unseen.
3. email: i would like a vehicle history but i use a different site since it's cheaper than carfax. here's the website, put in all the information. -  it's a fake site, just to collect our information."
"currently getting scammed from someone trying to purchase my shopify store hi, 

i’m selling my shopify store and i had someone reach out to me agreeing to buy it at list price but asked if they could pay through quickbooks payments (important). 

after i agreed to setup a free account with quick book payments, they gave me the classic “we had $37,000 budgeted for this project and because of transaction fees we need to send you all of our money, then we’d like you to subtract the amount for your store and send us back the rest.”

obviously a scam. but i’m curious:

1. what about quickbooks payments would allow them to get money from me without me keeping any money from them?

2. i’m contacting quickbooks, but is there anyway i can catch them?"

"backmarket.com tldr, seller gave me an older model than what i purchased. seller and website blamed each other, no one would honor the posting. backmarket refunded me, and then charged me again. curious to see if they’ll actually refund me for real. 


i purchased a 2016 macbook pro from backmarket, received a 2015 macbook pro from the seller tekreplay. i was told to contact the seller. tekreplay apologized for the error, told me i’d be refunded so i could purchase the correct model and to send back the device. i iet them know i did purchase the correct model but i was sent the wrong one. also wouldn’t it be easier for me to send back the wrong model so they could send me the correct one. to which i was informed that yes i did purchase the correct one according to the listing, but the listing was improperly tied to their product so i was sent the older model. now granted i did not find this out till i opened the box, they literally sent me an older model knowing full well i purchased the newer model. no email letting me know of the “error” or any sort of contact. 

at this point it’s evident that they attempted to rip me off. they let me know that they would not honor the posting i purchased. if i wanted i could repurchase the “correct model” which was apparently a couple hundred dollars more. so i contact backmarket and let them know that their seller literally tried to rip me off, and that i’m not interested in a refund, i want the model i purchased. backmarket let me know that there was an error in their listing and that there was no way for them to give me the 2016 model because tekreplay didn’t have it in their inventory. the resolution will be me getting a refund and purchasing the correct model that i want. 

i further pressed the issue of how this was literally false advertising and an attempt to defraud a brand new customer to their website. i point out that tekreplay has reviews across multiple websites where someone has purchased one thing and received another, and how bad it makes backmarket look. if tekreplay doesn’t have the model, and it was truly an issue with the website. then backmarket could honor the posting. they informed me they have no control over the vendors stock, but they would offer me a 5% discount for the inconvenience all this has caused. 

at this point i’ve already been refunded and it was over the weekend(which i work) so i couldn’t mail out the macbook. i replied back to tekreplay thanking them for wasting my time, trying to con me, and that i’d mail back the device at my earliest convenience with a tracking number, which would be monday(i also let backmarket know that). they said thanks, once we receive it in 1-2 business days i’d receive the refund. i let them know i was already refunded and they should count themselves lucky i’m not a terrible person that would keep the macbook and tell them to go kick rocks. fast forward 2 days later and now backmarket has helped themselves to withdrawing the funds they already refunded. i sent them a less than polite email about that. 

i will 100% be recording video of myself mailing the device back to them with tracking and signature confirmation because i don’t trust any of these people not to try to con me again. long story short, stay far far far far far away from these people and just buy from ebay from trusted sellers."

so i received a message on my page a girl claiming to work at buzzfeed and said if i share article i could earn some money . i agreed and then she sent me a link not phishing link no shady link official facebook business manager link and told me to add my page in facebook business manager under this link so they can track performance and boom with just one click i am no longer admin of my page . i cant believe how dumb facebook is for even allowing something like that, no warning , no verification, no request , no email, no password and no way to reverse that action also when facebook dont provide support theres very slim chances of getting your account back by reporting it . 

i never earned a penny through my facebook page and i spent some money to buy paid posts on similar pages to get followers it has became a hobby to share meme and i feel not good now, like i was kinda addicted to posting a meme a day on my page . sooner or later when i earn some money to put it on fb page i will create a page again . really sad day .

this is the phone number they provide in that link.  **01216 904321**     of course as a canadian i had to dial 011 44 before that number. can anybody help me figure out what's going on here?"

"craigslist scammer told me watch out i am selling some furniture and within 24 hours of posting it a guy emails. he tells me he is relocating and will have movers pick it up and his company is paying for it. so thought okay that could be a legit thing but not likely. i told him if/when the check comes i will cash it and wait 2 weeks before he can even send his movers to get it. give him the name and address to send the check to. the agreed amount was $600. 

he kept wanting my email after i gave him the name and address to send the check and i told him that this is my email i get the messages and if he wants to use a gmail account or whatnot he can copy and paste my craigslist email in the send to spot. 

this check comes yesterday (he emails me 2 minutes after it got delivered in my mailbox)  and it’s for $1500. supposed to be split between me and the movers. immediately i tear the check and respond back and say your check is in the garbage do not email me again or i will report you for fraud. he responds back saying i don’t understand do you want $1000 for the furniture and throwing out random numbers. i tell him again your check was ripped up and thrown out. he then proceeds to say he is going to have his company take legal action against me. i tell him good luck with no case. after that he said you better watch out for me i have your name, address and phone number (i never gave him my number). the last thing i said is fuck off but he does have my address and name for sure.

"“marketing to fortune 500 companies”? am i being scammed? a coworker pitched to me an opportunity to make money through marketing to fortune 500 companies? they mentioned they would educate you with the skills to run your own business. 

you have to go through an education phase with 5 steps which is also a vetting processs to see if the mentor would be willing to take you on. if you make it to the end, the mentor makes you an offer and you start a business/llc. 

it sounda like a pyramid scheme and i was skeptical the whole time. i thought it would be like credico but there’s no upfront cost. the education is free and you would only have to pay foe the llc. the peson who recruited me wouldnt make a comission directly off my sales but they would make comission. and it’s possible for the recruitee to make more money than the recruiter. theres also a guy who is willing to fly down to train you. theyre located everywhere including seattle, la, and colorado. 

the person recruiting me said that in her first year she was only making $100-500 a month which covered her initial overhead for starting the business. but now they have enough passive income to quit her current job ($80k). everything is also 100% online so no direct door to door sales. 

has anyone ever heard of this? or know more information about the actual business model?"

"can someone tell me what the goal is behind this scam? using a throwaway account, in case someone familiar with the situation spots this post.

tldr: i met a stranger who claims to be the owner of a business where he helps drive consumer traffic to websites. he's looking to teach someone about the industry he's involved in, and have them eventually become a business partner. what is he really trying to lure me into?

a few weeks ago i was out with a friend of mine, grabbing some food to go, when a stranger (lets call him jacob) complimented us on our shoes. while we waited for our order, we struck up a conversation with jacob to pass the time. turns out we live in the same general area, and shared a mutual interest in bbq and sneakers. before we left our food, jacob asked for my number. he seemed like a really chill dude, and i wasn't opposed to the idea of making a new friend, so i gave him my digits. a week later i get text from him about some new sneakers he purchased. we chatted about them for a bit before he calls me up to offer me an opportunity at making some cash on the side. he claimed to work in an industry where he helps other businesses gain a stronger web presence. he gave me an example that went something like this, ""i help businesses, like nike, spread their influence and gain more customers. for example, lets say someone sees an ad for a nike shoe while on youtube. if they end up clicking on that ad, and buy the shoe, i would make a certain percent off of that purchase."" he asked me if i'd be interested in learning more about that. wanting to keep an open mind, i agreed to meet up with him for coffee.  


before we met up for coffee, i sent jacob a text asking for some more info about what he does. his response was, ""i totally understand wanting to come prepared. i'd do the same. i'll be able to answer questions you have on wednesday. the main purpose of our getting together is to see if we even get along. which i suspect we will. you don't have to worry. it'll be laid back."" my bs meter was starting to go off, but i decided to keep on with the charade because maybe there was something to it. anyways, we meet up during lunch for about 40 minutes and i hardly get anything out of him. he talks a little bit about where he grew up, what he studied in school, and how he met someone who helped him start his business. then he talked about how, as a business owner, he's able to write off taxes and make much more money than someone who didn't own a business. it all came off like a sales pitch. he ended the meetup by assigning me some ""homework."" he wanted me to read an article about the differences between entrepreneurs and employees, watch a video on automation, and write down a list of my 10 dreams and 10 nightmares. it was all very hokey. before i left, i asked him, ""is there any particular reason why you're choosing to talk with me about all of this? you're a pretty social guy. i imagine you talk to a lot of people. who else is in on this?"" he gave a vague response, saying that he wasn't talking with anybody else. when he met me the first time, he noticed we hit it off really well, so he figured he'd take a chance on me. i wasn't convinced, but i left our chat at that.  


a week later, we meetup for coffee (for the last time), and he still doesn't tell me much about his job other than what he first pitched me. i asked him what his business name was, and what key terms i could look up online to learn more about his industry. he gave me the name, but wasn't very helpful describing what terms i should look up. he said ""i'd love to go into more detail, but lunch hour is almost over and i don't have enough time to explain it all. are you free tomorrow evening? i want you to meet the guy who helped me start my business, and navigate the pitfalls. i need to know a time so i can reserve a spot for you. he likes to meet people one-on-one."" i told him my schedule was hectic, but i'd get back to him later.  after lunch, i immediately looked up his name and his business, and i couldn't find anything. i also tried to look up jobs that fit the description of what he claimed, but all i could find was search engine optimist (seo) positions. at this point, everything is super sketchy to me.  


so, what's the play here? what is this guy really trying to do? anyone here have experience with this kind of scam? if i had to guess, this guy is trying to sell me on some kind of mlm, but i'm not sure. i haven't talked with him since our last coffee meetup, and i have no plans to meet him further. i smell bs, and i'm trying to figure out what his end goal was. thanks in advance for your responses."

(immediate red flag for me..) then promised the loan would be in her bank account about an hour... never showed up. so then he does “research” finds out the bank put a red flag on the deposit... i believe it.. then asked for a 480$ cash forward to remove the red flag... and now tonight or tomorrow she is supposed to see the money... i’m severely concerned she got scammed, the only thing making it not sketchy, is he’s been in constant contact with her.. but i would too if i was a dumbass and believed every word.... how do i report the scam and get that money back? or is she out of luck?"
"how can i scam a scammer so i rented an air bnb in north bergen, new jersey last night 3/13 and he said (john, the renter) it was fine for us to throw a party. however; halfway through the night i get a text message from a number that is not john. obviously they got my # from john which is an invasion of privacy but whatever. this number wouldn’t give me their name, they told me they were “one of the owners” of the property and they received a noise complaint and the police issued her a $250 ticket. (wouldn’t the police come for a noise complaint and talk to the party directly??? that’s how it’s always been done in nj). so obviously i threatened to shut down their airbnb since it’s illegal to have an airbnb in north bergen, but i’m wondering if there’s some way i could get money either thru litigation (my uncles a lawyer) or through the police bc this unknown person tried to scam me. bc i’m basically so mad they tried to scam me and i wanna get them back."

is this an obvious scam? if they didn’t send me the code before sending them the payment and i have to refund the buyer then i’m obviously screwed... if they never send me the product after i’ve sent them their share of the profit then i’m out however much? 

i called ebay and they said this isn’t technically illegal as long as i get the product to the seller or the full discount, but that i would be disputing it with the bank or paypal and when i asked if they would allow me time to do so the answer wasn’t totally clear... would i have to pay them back immediately or could i wait until the dispute settles, or could i be in serious trouble if i can’t refund them immediately? 

i know it’s common sense not to pay a company before they pay you, but i guess in my desperation right now i’m hoping this is somehow legit...

please send us your ebay link to your listing for review and we’ll confirm back to you. if you have any questions send us an email 24/7 and we’ll answer you as quickly as possible. 

remember, digital/download products are no subject to refund as per the original listing and the item is not tangible, in other words; not retrievable. you can find this information on the original listing of your software. under certain circumstances, we will replace the key free of charge if and when it's required. never refund a sale to a buyer, always ask us. 

here the example below from welcome info. meaning the buyer would have paid you $230 and you send us $153.50. 

$230 - $153.50 = $76.50 gross profit for you in this example. 

“here an example of the calculation of the gross profit:
example, if you sell for $230 a “sage pro 1 user” and 
selling price $250 (supplier charge/cost $100).
$230 sold - $100 cost = $130 - $23 ebay selling fee
= $107 / 2 = $53.50 half gross profit
$100 cost + $53.50 half gross profit
= $153.50 to send to software source to order your item.”

$230 - $153.50 = $76.50 your gross profit

ebay selling fee is 10% on each sale and we split half and half. 

about us

we are a small software company intermediary between the affiliate marketers and the software supplier. we are specialized and professional with digital products with ebay and amazon marketing. as you know, more ebay selling accounts means more sales which means more profit. 

hence why we partner with affiliate marketers just like you who sell software on one or multiple ebay and amazon accounts.

we are not your employer, we offer business partnership opportunities, partnering with affiliate marketers. if you are interested in this business opportunity, you are in for success."

"is this site legit? [this](https://www.retailstherapy.com/) is a site that came across my path a while ago, and i was briefly interested in their elephant pants but didn't buy anything, too expensive. it's recently come back with heavily discounted pants, with proceeds going to a charity that will benefit elephant habitats. i'm a big fan of elephants and this style of clothing, so it's definitely up my alley. they're ending their collection (hence the sale) and will benefit something else. 

knowing that a lot of charities are often scams and having encountered some obvious (and some subtle) scammy websites, i decided to try and look more into it. i'll provide the general info, and am just wondering what sense to make of it all. it definitely has red flags, but i'm wondering how bad it seems. also, i'd still spend $10 on comfy pants, what is the risk factor? what if i use a prepaid card? 

it's hard finding their info online or reviews because of the brand's name - retailstherapy. it's a difficult thing to get clear, streamlined results from."

"interac to bitcoin as work from home? hey everyone,

thought i would ask here as i'm still having difficulty to find how they make money off this process.

i recently receive 2 work from home opportunities, one from a travel agency and one from a private consulting. both did have websites and some only presence (albeit very little). so i wasn't too skeptical yet.
then there was an application, an employment agreement, an over the phone interview with a call centre based out of montreal for one and ontario for the other. (of course neither accept phone calls, only outgoing). so far nothing extra suspicious.

both present the work as money processing for international customers, that we work with whatever the customer finds most convenient and many are actually using bitcoin. and that this saves time, expense from bank fees and transaction costs, as well as time (international transfers could take up to 5 days is what they mention).

anyways, both of the first tasks are to receive an interac deposit, keep a small portion of that as you percent bonus, then withdraw cash, exchange that for bitcoin and then transfer the bitcoin amount to the provided address.

how does this work on their end to profit?

and i did have autodeposit for 1 task, so how to in return the amount if interac or my bank say they are not able to trace the sender?

thanks!"

"anyone seen anything like this? not 100% sure if this is a scam but maybe it will sound familiar to someone.
today i got a call from a random mobile number in the uk (i live in the uk). about a minute later i get a text reading: ""i am try to call you"". i noticed the slightly broken english so assumed it was a scam call wanting to verify if there was a person on the end of the phone number. 

3 minutes later i get a second call from the same number and yet again another text about a minute after reading: ""i am try to call you but you are not pick up my phone  📞"". once again broken english and this time an emoji which was put in despite the fact that no-one would put an emoji there, i thought that maybe it was their way of making it seem human. 

another 5 minutes later and yet another phone call followed by another message: ""who are you canyou telly me what is your name"". at this point i was convinced that this is some sort of scam looking to find my identity; why would someone who is calling me need to know my name if they made it seem like they knew me?

finally as i was writing this post, about 16 minutes after the previous message, i get another call and once again, another message: ""pick up phone i am try to call you but you are not pick up.your phone ,📞"". this also has similar mistakes in grammar which leads me to believe maybe google translate was involved in writing the message. 

this is still going on so i'll update with any extra info as i get it. i don't think it is someone i know as i don't recognise the number and i haven't given out my number in a while, i mostly use social media to message anyway. i don't want to text back incase my name is added to a calling list or i get charged for the text but if you know what this is then let me know.

tl;dr: i keep getting phone calls from a random number followed by texts in broken english."

the other day a cell phone designed for the elderly was delivered to the house and a subscriptions was set up and paid for. he had to cancel the plan and workout an arrangement with the company to send the phone back.

a few days later he started receiving boxes from hello fresh, upon calling on his behalf i discovered someone associated with a strange gmail account had paid for 6 months worth of food with his card, despite it being canceled.

so what exactly is the scam here? why are they sending these things to his house? what benefit is it to the scammer? should i be on the lookout for something bigger to come?

"is this a scam or a technical mistake? (best buy fake account) recently i got email saying that i signed up for a bestbuy.com account. this was weird. one minute later i received another email saying thank you for my purchase which freaked me out. the email was sent to a “jack” (not the real name) and it listed a “darryl” to pick up the computer at a best buy. 

1. checked all my cards - absolutely no activity 
2. i logged on (by changing my password), i got this guys name, address, and phone number.
3. i called bestbuy and cancelled the order

b. why did this guy use my email to sign up?

dear customer,

sorry to keep you waiting. .

i'm sorry you disagree with my suggestion. in this case, how about we provide a 20% refund of the total price of the order , and you can just keep the item. i promise to modify my ad, you know your kindness will help me very much many.
according to our substantial experience, it will cost you more than 20usd for shipping the product back to us, and customers need to be responsible for the returning shipping fee.

warm prompt: please do not send the item back until we authorize the return with the returning address in the email. also, the address on the package is not our returning address, do never send the package to that address, or we will not be responsible for the loss.

if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

my question is if i screwed myself over by answering the call and also saying yes. i already know i’m probably about to be flooded with spam calls again soon. but my bigger worry is if i should be worried about anything more malicious such as my previous shopping site accounts being hacked or something like that. a few months ago, a hacker got into my walmart account and ordered $80 worth of stuff. my credit card notified me of the purchase so i immediately canceled the transaction and let my credit card company know what happened. it was my first time being hacked like that so now i’m more scared than usual about this type of stuff.

"text messages over the past couple months asking to buy a house that isn't mine. i've got a weird one for you. since january or february ive gotten a text that goes something like ""hi, i'm eve (name is always the same) and i was wondering if youd be i terested in selling your property at (xxx address). i've never responded,only blocked and deleted. i'm not positive but i think the address has always been the same, at least the street has if not the whole address. googling the phone numbers has never turned up anything suspicious. here's the kicker though, i did a phone # search online for my number, and it had me linked to that address that i got texted about. i've lived within an hour or so of it, but nowhere near the exact address.

"i think i just got scammed, need help got scammed cause i am an idiot and did not verify anything. also, cause i am a horny fuck. 

met a girl online late last night, she presented herself as a korean living in germany who needs help from ""a generous gentleman"" paying her rent (120 euro). i offered a to buy her a plane ticket to come to the uk to see me the next day and stay for a week with me. and then i would give her the 120 euro for rent.

she gave me some bullshit about already being late on rent etc, so could i send it first. i did like an idiot. but... she (he?) didn't block me! instead we proceeded to arrange the plane ticket. gave me name and passport number. ticket bought by me, but her the passenger, so technically i am the airline client.

right when the plane was supposed to take off, this is 18 hours after i sent the money and bought the ticket, she blocked me. why wait until now? so i don't cancel the ticket? does that mean she is actually on the plane? 

i am currently on the way to the airport and will get there 15 min before the airplane. i plan on talking to the airline and see if they somehow changed the information for the passenger. it might have been possible because it wouldn't properly accept the info i was giving on the website and it said the passenger wohld have to go to their desk to verify. will they give me the info if it's been updated? can i explain its fraud and get them detained on landing? 

honestly, i make enough money so i don't even care about getting it back. this is part of the reason i took the plunge - it wasn't much. i just hate that i was stupid enough to get scammed and want revenge. any ideas? literally anything to make them miserable. 

could someone else be on that plane? not the scammer but someone who has no idea what's going on? i just can't fathom why they wouldn't judt block me after i sent the koney, unless this is some evil person who just wants to make me go to the airport and waste my time.

they are all very evasive and say they can't tell her where they got her number but she is spending a lot of time trying to get off their supposed list.

"new ebay seller scam i have a new “seller scam” item not received 

i purchased a $1250 dji drone last week through auction and won. 

i immediately payed seller, seller ships my item, manually enters tracking number into ebay.  

i wait for shipment to be delivered on the day of delivery (i also have a security cam front of my house and witnessed the delivery of mailman)

mailman delivers 2 letter mail and no package, then 5 min later, tracking number is marked as delivered and received but i got no package and nothing through informed delivery. 

here’s how the scam (from what i gather happened)

seller google maps my address and finds a nearby address on my same street.  seller delivers something/anything to that address and leaves the name of buyer blank on the shipping label.   seller manually enters tracking number into ebay. so it looks to ebay and buyer he sent me the package. 

here’s the funny part, i have “informed delivery” through usps.  when seller marked shipped through ebay, i not once got a notification through usps of a package enroute to my address, which i though was weird but didn’t think much of it. 

so i file a “item not received” through ebay and this is where it gets hard to prove your case and get the documentation ebay requires. 

since the item was not delivered in my name (seller left that blank)(confirmed through usps)) and the item was not delivered to my address (also confirmed with tracking through usps) usps is not going to give you any information because you have no claim to that. 

through hours and hours on the phone and in person talking with usps, i was able to at least get a letter from usps that tracking # did indeed not arrive at my address and that it was not shipped in my name.

still going through refund process as i write this, so will see what happens. 

now this has all been confirmed through usps investigation."

last night someone called my gf while i was out picking up dinner. i get back and she's in tears... the conversation goes immediately into, ""be honest with me..."" she said someone called her from her own phone number, had a modulated voice, and asked if she knew what her boyfriend was up to this weekend and if she knew who i was with? proceeding to say, ""i just didn't want him to think he was getting off the hook."" then they hung up. no names were indicated at all; it was all extremely vague.

to make this matter worse, i happened to be in chicago for work this past weekend. so now i'm having to explain--even tho she knew where i was and who i was with the whole time--my entire trip in detail. this has turned into a huge argument and trust issues and all because of some hoax i cannot explain. even tho i point out how peculiar it is they mentioned no names. not hers, not mine, not even the fact i was in chicago. and also using illegal tech to mirror her phone number. she just flat out believes this caller because it's too suspicious that i actually happened to be out of town. and i can't explain this in any way that makes sense because...well....what the hell is the end game?? they didn't ask for money for proof or anything like that. just a spoof call to spook my girl.

and now i'm stuck trying to figure this thing out so our relationship doesn't actually suffer from this extremely odd incident. any help or insight on this particular type of hoax would be incredibly helpful!"

"scammed from a long-time reddit user i’d post his username, but not sure if that’s against the rules... 

i’m usually pretty cautious with buying tickets from random people, and have actually had a lot of success with buying/selling with people from reddit. i took a look at his reddit profile, which he’s had for six years, there were a couple of posts that kind of made me raise my eyebrow, but other than that everything looked good. i talked to him via phone call and text, exchanged info (ig, sc, ids), and eventually i felt comfortable enough to buy a festival ticket from him and paid him on february 26.

now, he’s in seattle/vancouver, washington while i’m in las vegas, nv. the event was to be held next weekend in los angeles, ca. 

a couple days pass when i initially paid him and i asked him for an update and he said he was too busy to mail the ticket. come to find that he’s actually made other new posts saying he’s still selling his ticket. i called him out on it and he said i’m looking for “best offer” and if he received another offer he would pay me back... 

we went back and forth for the past several weeks and he kept stringing me along and giving me excuses of why he hasn’t mailed the ticket... now during this time i thought ok, since he’s actually replying back to me then maybe he’s not scamming cuz most scammers would probably stopped all communication upon receiving the payment. 

one of the things he was very adamant about was me paying for the shipping, so i said np, send me a pic of the receipt and i’ll pay you.

however, yesterday the festival announced they were postponing the event due to the corona virus and that they would issue a refund if you can’t make the new festival date. so i asked him what the status was and he immediately said “i shipped the ticket”. (i’m sure he figured out that now he could just get refunded and on top of that take my money). he wouldn’t provide any proof that he shipped the ticket even though he said he would send me the receipt and a video of him mailing the ticket... and now he’s stopped communicating. 

i’m just taking it as a loss and lesson learned at this point. i’ve read that i can file a police report and i’ve also contacted the moderators of all the subs he posted in selling the ticket. is there anything else that i could do? i just don’t feel like wasting my energy and time anymore on this guy, but feel like now since he was successful with this, unfortunately he will do it again.."

"think we got scammed in france over glasses. my wife needed new glasses. we walked into a shop and the owner said he had a cool new machine that could figure out her prescription so she could get new glasses. she did the test, and she wanted no line bifocals. we don't speak french, so the guy was trying to speak english, and he says that the glasses and frames will be 699 euros, and he is going to throw in a ""free"" pair of sunglasses she wanted. we put 250 euros on the credit card as a deposit. my wife goes back a week later and he charges her another 750 euros for the glasses. when she protested, he just showed her the breakdown on the bill, 350 for each lens, plus frame and coatings. we were stupid for not getting something in writing when we paid the deposit. i feel really stupid. is there anything we can do?"
"hoping someone can explain this one to me...claiming a cheating spouse so i got a follow request on instagram, from someone using a fake name, no profile picture, and no posts. when this happens i automatically reject the invite. but then they sent a message through saying ""i'm not trying to be creepy or anything, but is this (my name), married to (husband)?"". i just replied ""who is this"", and they said ""if this is (my name), your husband is cheating on you""

he isn't. he is a good, honest man, and i trust him completely. but it's not just blind trust. i know for certain he isn't. we work together and (obviously live together). he literally wouldn't have the opportunity.... so my question is, what's the end game here? i'm thinking ""give me money and i'll send proof""?"

she didn't recognize the number when dialing, and i also don't have her number saved but it showed the area which i recognized, so i picked up. she was shocked to hear my voice, as was i. she told me the story, and here we are.

she didn't ask for any information, not even chit chat. she seemed as weirded out about this as i was.

"need info for peace of mind i just fell victim to a sexual blackmailing scam. i initiated contact on hinge, because her profile said she was 22 and mentioned something about being dominant - so i thought i’d shoot my shot. well pretty quickly we were exchanging  photos and videos, and then i was threatened to have those pictures and videos shared unless i paid 900 euro. i rolled my eyes and ignored it, and then received a screenshot of the video being sent to my aunt. i told him i would contact my lawyer and have not responded since.

my question - do i need to be worried about this info actually getting shared or was this an idle scam that i should just move on from?

i know it was stupid and i need to be more careful online - lesson learned, but any info about what to expect next would really ease the series of panic attacks i’ve been having.

"check scam i know i’m a complete idiot, but i fell for a fake sugar daddy scam online, and was talked into giving him by bank login to receive what i thought was going to be a legal check for $500. what i did not know is you can view the checks you mobile deposited so he was able to copy my check from my employer and put it into my account for $500. so i think i just got $500 from him not my employer and he asked me to buy him $300 in steam cards, so i did. the next day, my mom asked me why my employer gave me $500 ( i was 16) and i was confused until she showed me a check for $500 from my employer in my account that i could just see as a deposit in my account. i did not tell her about how it happened, and just acted like my account got hacked because i didn’t want to get in trouble, or reveal my sexuality as i was talking to a sugar daddy which would be strange. i immediately texted my manager to tell him about the check when i found out, and brought him $500 the next day ($300 of my own money because the guy would not return it) however, the checks kept being made by the guy who deposited them into different accounts and the amount summed to $7500 or $8000 so a police investigation was opened. i didn’t think i had anything wrong i do with it, it was also my last week of work at this place so i didn’t think to much about it after. recently i was called into the station and asked what happened, still did not tell him because i was scared and i’m an overall shy person and did not want things to come out right then. he then got a warrant to look at my phone, asked a few more questions and we left. i then had to get a lawyer as i seemed to be the suspect. i told the lawyer everything and i went with him to the station and told them everything and was given my phone back and they didn’t seem to want to go further. but now that you have some context, my question is can i be held legally responsible for this? for simply giving him my bank login? and am i responsible to pay back the full $8000 that was taken from my employer? only $500 was ever put into my account and i gave them that money back right away but i’m 17 and just spent $5000 on a lawyer so i don’t really have money to throw around for something i didn’t do. any help would be greatly appreciated!!!!"

"recieving payment via google pay... will these precautions protect me? how can i be scammed, and what should i look out for? (context and details below) hey! so if someone were to pay me through google pay, is there a way for them to scam me? here are the specific circumstances/precautions:

~ i would create a new gmail account that is not connected to any personal information about me.

~ i would use that email account to sign up on google pay. i would not connect my bank account or any card to the account until after the transaction has gone through. 

~ all the customer would have in terms of information they would need to send the payment is my email address associated with my google pay. no bank info.

~ i would not be doing anything related to sending money back or buying things (cards especially) for the customer. i would continue to be cautious to avoid the other types of scams. 


**within the circumstances listed above, what i would be doing is telling the customer my email address, and they would send the agreed upon payment to the google pay account connected to it. only after the payment goes through completely and i have transferred it to another account would i follow through with giving the customer the final product. the customer would have agreed to this, and would have already recieved a preview-version as proof that i am not scamming them.**

oh, and before anyone makes accusations, i can assure you that i am not breaking any laws. :)

"how can i help my grandma avoid being scammed again? i really hope this is an appropriate question for this subreddit; if it isn’t, please let me know where else i can post it!

my (28f) sweet grandma (bubbe), who is 87, has been taken in by scammers for upwards of $11,000 over the past year and a half. my mother, sister, and i have sent her all kinds of information on how to avoid scams, spoken with her at length about the tactics scammers use, and offered to look over any emails/texts/phone calls that seem suspicious. her mental acuity is not diminished in any significant capacity; she was tested for alzheimer’s/dementia less than 6 months ago. 

despite this, bubbe continues to fall for these horrible, evil tactics (most recently: the “irs” one, the “we are calling from your bank” one, and the “i’m your grandson in germany and i need you to paypal me money” one). i have a degree in computer science and i, personally, have tried my best to educate her by explaining how even tech-savvy people get taken in by these scams and how she needs to be really careful and generally suspicious of *anyone* requesting money from her. i’ve told her so many times that she can use me as a resource whenever she needs, and i catch up with her often and try to ask her as many pointed questions about it as i can without making her feel like a child. part of the problem is that she won’t tell us about these things until weeks after it has happened; possibly because of embarrassment?

i’m kind of at my wits end here, and i’m just not sure what else i can do. does anyone know what else my family and i can try? she’s an independent woman and she’s perfectly capable of caring for herself in every other aspect of her life. we just want to help our bubbe without being belittling or making her feel incapable."

this is how it works; the basic premise of the ""paid to drive concept is to get people, regular citizens, professional drivers, and all car owners above eighteen(18) years old, to go about their normal routine as they usually do, only with an advertisement for ""2020 u.s. open championship"" plastered on their cars. the advertisements are typically vinyl decals, also known as ""auto wraps"" that almost seem to be painted on the vehicle, and which will cover some portion of your car's exterior surface. you can decide to opt for a full wrap or a sticker. the full wrap will cover the whole exterior surface of the car while the  sticker will be on both doors as well as the hood so you can choose between and the pay doesn’t differ !

we have adopted this scope as it has been tested and certain to bring us more exposure and awareness since the wraps tend to be colorful, eye-catching and attracts lots of attention

selected candidates will be compensated with $300 weekly and this program is expected to last for six(6) months and the minimum period you can participate is two(2). due to the teeming candidates willing to participate in the program, we have signed agreements with few private specialists who will be responsible for placing and removing the advert placement on your car so as not to leave any damage/dent on your car during placement as well as removal.

if you feel this is a good fit and can participate for not lesser than 2 months, kindly provide the requested information below

"unconventional contractor scam, just when i thought i'd heard them all... i've seen many scams on this sub, most of course online/fake check/etc. in-person scams are more rare. scams by someone you know well and worked with for months rarer still...

a close family member who is an experienced renovator recently did a full renovation on their house, stripped down to studs. big contracts for every tradesperson involved, including the plumber - north of $20k worth of plumbing. three bathrooms, in floor heating throughout, etc. one guy going it. lots of shoddy work, lots of guidance from the (experienced) owner managing the site part-time.

they moved in a few months ago and just got their first power bill. it's astronomical, 3 or 4x what it should have been. they took a look and discovered that the brand new $1800 electric boiler they got installed is actually a 1987 junker which had been repainted and polished up beautifully to look brand new on the outside. they dug through receipts and discovered the ""invoice"" from a local appliance store they had paid the plumber for; it was actually just a printed quote. the plumber had sent them the quote for an $1800 boiler, billed them for it along with installation, and then purchased a $150 refurbished hunk of junk from some rednecks running a scrapyard and installed that.

the owners feel absolutely mortified that they somehow let this slip, of course. as i said, they are very experienced renovators, this is their second full house flip as a couple and his 5th or 6th large renovation project that he's managed. just goes to show that you're never too smart to get swindled.

needless to say, they will be taking him to court. at this point it's straight up fraud, doesn't seem like purely a civil matter. if it was shoddy work, it's a civil matter. intentionally defrauding a client seems like a criminal matter though, am i right? should they be contacting the police as well as just their lawyer?

the silver lining is that they were planning to flip and sell this house, but because of recent tax law changes, they decided to move in to it. had they sold the house without this knowledge, they could have been the ones being taken to court right now."
seems legit. 
they’re getting better

"tracing someone who logged on my google account. first of all, i would just like to clear that this is my first post on reddit let alone this subreddit so i apologize for any mistakes or violations. secondly, i'm not sure if this is a scam or not so i apologize once again. anyway, to the story:

after receiving a email from google that an unknown device had attempted to access my google account on firefox, five hours ago. it was blocked, and among a few details google displayed it also had the device's ip address on the email; i put it through an ip tracer *\[yes, a legal one\]* and got three locations in and around peterborough. with a bit of refining, i got the exact location inside peakirk. with a bit more tracing i found his/her's email, isp, hostname, email, and country. i believe this must've been a computer trying to find active emails to sell or something. but, i also got some sort of handheld device. now, so that's karma on some sort of level. i won't publish his email as it violates the subreddits rules so you'll have to take my word for it. its fine, you don't have to believe me.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

[i'm also not sure if putting the isp out is legal or allowed, also why is the first word in their email 'abuse'?](https://preview.redd.it/b1cwf6v0r3m41.png?width=389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1ed6cecc016d5dcbca9835b20062982cb4c7af8)"

"homeadvisor’s 30,000 fake positive reviews on trustpilot. i recently had a very negative encounter with home advisor as a contractor.  i can assure you, they are a giant scam and ripped my company off for roughly $800. from the sitejabber reviews, that i found way too late, i am not the only one to have the exact same experience. 

i can’t comprehend how both of these overtly fraudulent entities are still in operation.  or how to procure 30,000 fake reviews?

"some older people i know have been telling me that sylvia browne predicted coronavirus in ‘end of days’ i know its bullshit. the prediction is on page 312 and the book is supposedly full of predictions so you are bound to get a few of them right.

the prediction goes:
in around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments. almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely.

could someone post a few other predictions from the book which are obviously fake, obvious enough for even old people to believe. or if someone could send me pdf of the whole book so i could see it for myself. i don’t want to purchase a book with crazy bullshit."
"galaxy roses those popular galaxy roses that every girl is raving about that cost $25 for one, can be found on ebay for $1 from china. 

the website states that they"" take the roses that are grown from our various farms and use a special technique that freezes them. we then use the frozen moldings as a model. then we coat the stems in 24k gold, then we hand place each iridescent holographic coated petal which makes the roses look so eye-catching""

"strange e-bay purchases, but delivered to me?! so this is very bizarre, but i have an ebay account and a few days ago i got an alert that someone had tried to log in from an unknown location. i turned on 2-step verifcation and went about my life. last night/this morning i get a notification that a $4 healing crystal purchase was made from my account on one of my saved credit cards (through paypal).

i immediately call ebay and alert them of this, they say they will cancel the transaction and to follow up with paypal. i did both and have disputed the transactions. i have changed passwords, updated my 2-step verification and deleted the credit cards saved on ebay. 

the people at ebay say the person logged on on the 6th from bangladesh and when i set up my 2-step verification on the 7th they were already logged in.

the strange thing is, why such a small purchase? why send it to my address? am i being set up for something bigger to occur? should i change all of my bank passwords?"
"so a guy tried to scam me and i was “too annoying to sell to” even though i was just asking some reasonable questions so i saw this guy saying he could give you free stuff in game for 15$ now i went to investigate and it was already very suspicious he turned comments off during the video and gave no proof of him actually giving people what they asked for so i kept asking him questions to see if he was going to scam me and i knew back about a year ago you couldn’t do this so i was wondering if you can now so i asked my buddy if it was, he said no ( should’ve done this in the beginning) so i was about to confront the guy and he said i’m not selling to you you’re too annoying and i thought it was so funny."

"carethy.com online store is taking money from people all over the globe. they’re show up at the top of google search, website is very thorough and convincing, but after you make a purchase they disappear. how can they be stopped? maybe i’m the fool, but this online store advertises hand sanitizer for sale and is a top google search result. it’s a very professional looking website, available in various different languages, very thorough. the website cites a 2-3 week wait for product, i didn’t find it inconceivable that merchants could restock depending on their supply, didn’t strike me as “too good to be true,” so i placed an order. they charged me 2 extra euros for something called a “yoga guarantee.” when i searched to find out what that was, i found the reviews that they’re a giant scam and accept money but never send either product or refund. i immediately sent a cancellation and refund request, have received no reply despite a second request. now i see from online reviews that they never refund money. they just disappear. 

i expect that they’re doing huge business with the sanitizer thing, all over the world. how can something like this be stopped?

"offerup scam so was trying to buy a nintendo switch and two games for $200. was asked to do apple pay, and i thought my money would be protected by apple or my bank but i was wrong. they messaged me from this number 5165082541 and was told to send the money to his “girlfriend” at 5167245289. says his name is tommy webber. dumb as hell now that i think about it but i was excited for such a good deal. two days go past and i don’t hear from the seller. check offerup and they’ve deleted their account. i started calling them back to back they answered and hung up then didn’t answer at all. i get a facetime from them didn’t show their faces and i didn’t show mine but they laughed about stealing my money and buying weed with it, said they’d never get caught. i got on twitter and searched their numbers, found a post about them scamming another girl out of $200 from 2019. so i found his twitter it’s @tommydub11 and i’ve spoken to multiple people who have gotten scammed by them. they’ve scammed tickets for concerts, coachella, rolling loud etc. phones, macbooks anything you can think of they’ve scammed ppl and since it’s through apple pay nobody gets their money back and they’re never caught. i reported it to the police and there’s an ongoing investigation, but if anybody has dealt with these two or is thinking about it stay away! and if you have any info please let me know, because now i’m out $200 and multiple people are screwed as well."

these all happened two days ago at the moment of this writing. the following day (which was yesterday) i immediately called pse&amp;g for any record of this change to sfe energy. lo and behold, there was, though still pending. i immediately told them to stop that process, which pse&amp;g was happy to do so. i have two documentations from pse&amp;g for that transaction. first, a document stating the change to sfe energy effective 4/15. the second, a document stating to cancel it, effective 4/14.  


tl;dr  
1. am i screwed?

2. will i be screwed in the near future, seeing that these scumbags have my pse&amp;g account number?

3. is there anything i can do stop them from trying things without my consent, since they have my pse&amp;g account number, e.g. tell pse&amp;g to block any motions to change or even change my account number entirely?"

"im involved in a app gift card scam and i reallynneed advice or help. im not really gonna go into how or where i met this person but i have been scammed through google hangouts for about 4k. i know i should never do this but i did it anyways and i gave out the account log in to my credit card. i figured there is no way someone can get the actual numbers w.o issuing a new card. (i changed the address and everything). they offered to pay off all the debt on it and so i gave it out just to see if they would. i had 900 on the card at the time, the 900 was paid off. they then said they wanted ebay cards and i asked them why? they said they use it for bit coin trading or something to that affect. they wanted an absurd amount and i told them no, i should of stopped and blocked them then. i told them id only be comfortable doing it for the same amount my card had owed. they agreed and i got 900, i waited for the money to post and when it did it was paided off. 


they then asked for me to do it again the sum being bigger and again i said no and went with 1k. i know that you cannot return a payment to a credit card because i have attempted in doing so by accidentally over drafting an account and wanting to pay with a different acct number and i could not do it. eventually we get to 4k in total, and one of the payments came back to my card as a ""clk 2 pay rtn error"" dismayed by what it may be i called my card company about it. they person paid back that error amount with a different bank acct number. when my bank explained that the money was rejected on the other end and sent back i demanded why and asked them. they told me that account was low on funds and they used a differing one. i told them i would not be doing the cards anymore at all and now i am stuck in what to do and or say to my bank. as of now all the payments are ""processed"" but i want them to stay on the other side block this person and move on. i have their last 4 acct number and bank and wondering if i should report them their bank. if i can just tell citi my acct was hacked all together and i dont know what those purchases are. im unsure and i would like some solid advice, i know i am stupid and i should of never done it and im highly ashamed. 

for anymore trying to ""bro"" shame me im not male."

"i got scammed when i was trying to be a good person i was walking with a co-worker in our way to a restaurant when someone who was driving a car asked us if we speak english (this happened in mexico city, btw).

we approached to this guy and he started to talk about if we knew a place where you can sell a cellphone, he realised we didn't know and proceed to tell us how much money needed because he was trying to pay the rent car he was driving, fill the gas tank, pay his rent and get back to his country (told us he was from france), show us his id, his rent car bill... in general he was convincing us to trust him. in this point i was suspecting something but...

you know, when we saw him we knew he wasn't mexican, he didn't speak a good spanish and his english was also pretty bad but he had a weird accent and sometimes he was speaking in french. now we realise

 how good actors these people are but i wouldn't be surprised if he is indeed a foreigner. we both are good people, so, we really wanted to help him.

then he show to us an iphone 11 and told us he was trying to sell it in 6k pesos (300 usd) and if we knew someone who wanted to buy it we just give him a call. give us his ""number"" and then my friend and i (in our good will) started to think if we buy his phone just to help him (not really for the phone), we agreed and told him that we'll see him in the next corner, i withdrawed 6k pesos and went to the guy's car.

my friend was in the front sit and i was in the back, i started testing the phone and it was legit there was no account and we decided to buy it, then show us that he was gonna give us everything and shit. the last thing i remember is that he put the iphone box in a bag and then he started to give us his french number and talked we should call him if we go to europe, he give the bag to my friend and i gave him the money. i thought my friend checked if everything was ok with the bag and the cellphone, he didn't. we got out of the car, walked a block and my friend gave me the bag. i tried to open it, it was glued, i was like ""fuck, no"", i ripped it and yeah, there was a juice box in the bag. most expensive juice box i have ever buy.

in a investigation we found out that in the neighbornhood we work it's full of scammers, particulary foreigners.

lesson learned. i'm not going to help anyone ever in the street, not even foreigners. now i start to believe that being a ""good"" person doesn't help in anything. at least it was 150/150 usd each, so... yeah, we got fucked."

"scammer loses it this was a couple of years ago when the fakes microsoft support calls just started. my wife had received a call, ostensibly from microsoft, saying one of our computers was infected and needed services. she went along with, remember, those were still innocent times, right up to the point where the caller wanted my wife to install team viewer onto one of my computers. she suggested i would call them back when i got home from work.

at the time in addition to my day job i was also running a home based business in media-optics, non linear editing and animation. i had a small render farm consisting of 6 networked units, plus my master work station. giving these fuckers remote access would have been catastrophic, luckily my wife clued in before she went to far.

when i got home she told me the story and gave me the phone number. i googled the number and it came up as ms scam. after dinner i poured myself a big rum &amp; coke, gathered my wits and called the number. i had decided in advance that i was going to act both as stupid as possible and also take everything he said as literal as possible. i went with the alabama red neck voice to round out the facade.

he started out by asking me what i saw on my desktop, i said my stapler, my pencil jar, my box of brightly coloured post-it notes and my water glass dipping bird. i went into extended descriptions of each item and would not let the guy interrupt me or get a word in edgewise. i finally let him speak and he asked me to move my mouse.

ewwww! i screamed, a mouse, gross! i’m not touching a mouse! then he asked me to open a browser window, but i told him it was raining outside and i didn’t want to get wet. every single thing he asked me i either played dumb or reacted to it literally. i had him on the phone for over an hour, he was patient and tenacious! i got up from time to time for another drink and was getting quite sloshed. 

he finally started trying to get me to install team viewer, i told him my team was green bay and my viewer was my tv set with tin foil on the rabbit ears. i guess i pushed him too far because his demeanour suddenly changed and he called me a cock sucker. it was so out of the blue i asked him to repeat it and he called me a cock sucker again!

i dropped my fake accent and told him that was not a nice thing to say. he asked me if wasting his time for a hour was a nice thing to do? i countered with was ripping people off a nice thing to do? he called me alcock sucker again, i told him to get a life or a real job and we hung up. i figured the hour plus he spent with me was time he wasn’t messing with other people. 

i was able to mess with a couple others like this, not to that extent, but a couple played along for awhile, but over time they started to get smarter, or at least less patient."

"can someone tell me how this scam would work https://cafelavista.com

their investment/franchise opportunity page: they are basically offering a 92% return on a £3000 investment after 6 years, supposedly guaranteed in fixed monthly payments. 

if you look at their model, you pay for the machine (3000) and rent it back to their other company which will pay you this fixed rent payment for 6 years which amounts to a 92% return. effectively they are financing their machines at a ridiculously high rate when they could just get money from a bank or some other source at a lower cost. for this reason i'm convinced it's a scam of some sort but i want to know exactly how."
"i'm a freelancer and just made a deposit with what i believe is a fraudulent account i freelance design where i also end up handling a good amount of consulting for busy business men. i've been so stressed out in general, i didn't think twice that this potential client wanted to give me an account number to pay towards a credit card of mine as deposit. i've worked a legit gig before with a rushed ceo who had me do as such and would reimburse me with a deposit. well, for this i did a general google search and agree 100% this would only come from a victim and then become a relationship asking me to do more. am i right? how vulnerable am i now? i can't call my bank at the moment but i've e-mailed them all details and will call in the morning."
"astoria activewear i purchased activewear from astoria activewear, and found their business practices quite scammy. firstly, they do their best to obscure that they are a chinese brand by claiming to operate out of virginia beach, but after placing my order the shipping was from china and took just under a month for me to receive my clothing. *they charge outrageous prices, but mitigate this by offering 50% coupon codes at all times.* **they claim to have a good return policy for store credit** as well, which is very important when it comes to buying tight fitting clothes online. this is where the setup turns into a scam. after trying on the cheaply made chinese clothes, i had a few items that didn't fit correctly, which i wanted to exchange. as it turns out though, **they don't actually do refunds or store credit**. instead they issue a coupon code which gives you a discount in the amount of what you should get as a refund or store credit. this cannot be combined with the 50% off coupon code, which means **if you want to exchange you are essentially exchanging for half as much as originally purchased.** for instance, if i buy ""$100"" worth of clothes at 50% off for $50 and choose to exchange it, you now only have the option to buy $50 worth of full price clothing. due to the nature of buy clothes online, this essentially means that you will get gypped off on the stuff that doesn't fit. i tried to reach out to the company about this. they responded to my first email saying that is simply the policy. they did not respond to further emails pointing out that it is an unfair policy. further you will have to wait a month between trying on clothes, as the business is not actually run out of virginia... i can't stress enough that this is a cheap, scammy, chinese company."

"victoria's secret product testing scam hi i need help &amp; i'm very scared. i'm in a facebook page for my sorority and there was a post in there about product testing for victoria's secret and the girl said that her cousin had done this and they were looking for new people to test out products. there was a google doc to fill out, and then at the end there was an email to get in contact with to ""continue your application"" on google hangouts. after you emailed a picture of yourself to this email, they sent a long paragraph about the ""at home sizing app"" they are creating, but because the app isn't ready yet, they are going to launch a version in google hangouts to get your ""accurate sizing for product testing"". they will ask you to wear tight fitting clothing and say your name, age, height &amp; weight. then they launch a facetime like call with no one on the other side, and they communicate with you through the chat feature. once you're on camera, they will tell you to turn to the side, front etc and then will ask you to change into a bra and underwear and say/ do the same things. after this, they ask you to speak about what you love most about your body and any situations where you have felt harassed or violated by men. after this, they'll ask you if you want to continue with the sizing process (or whatever they called it) and then will ask you to remove your bra. as soon s this happened, i knew this was not right and i asked them to verify if they were really from victoria's secret, and then they said they would send me a confirmation email about it and they never did. while i was not naked in this, i am still very worried about what it being done with this footage of me and i am afraid that it could affect future jobs. has anyone else has an experience like this or knows what i should do? i've already been in contact with the police and sexual assault hotline, but i feel very violated and i don't know what to do"

"can you scam someone through a bill pay? i got a message from a post on my other account for dating. she claims to be wealthy and wants to be a ""sugar mommy"". i quickly thought it was a scam but i had time so i decide to go along with it. this messaging between us has been going on since friday. she claims that she will give me a weekly allowance for keeping her company and being trustworthy. it sounds too good to be true... anyways i try to reverse image search each photo and nothing comes up. i try flipping her photos and still nothing. it could be that the images are unique as she gives me personal images. all of the photos i ask for she manages to make, so i pretty sure i'm talking to the girl i'm seeing. however, i will ask her for a video call soon, once i have more time today.

so i've also asked her about how she is going to send the money. her response was that her bank stopped approving her transactions through third parties to protect her account. she can only send money through a ""bill pay"". after a little research on the bill payments, the sender in most cases needs to know the account number, email and address of the recipient. is this correct? also, is it safe to give info like this? i know routing number and account numbers are not safe to send so i'm positive this is a scam. thank you in advance for any help as i'm not too informed on how these scams work."

on the phone, they stressed that i should take the online course and not meet with a face to face tutor, which if it is a scam could be because they don’t actually have any tutors (or just because the employees are told to sell that more if it’s real idk). they also asked if i was going to pay for it myself or with the help of someone.

i just wanted to know if anyone here has any experience with them and could tell me if varsity tutors is real or a scam."

"retail management- please educate your employees and yourselves regarding gift/visa card purchases! there are countless links out there so please feel free to fill the comments with them.

i had one of my credit card numbers stolen somehow over the weekend and used in several stores. one of the stores helped me and gave me some information regarding what was purchased. they used a duplicate card in a store 3 states away and bought a ton of visa gift cards, with my card and using a second (probably stolen) card in the same transaction.

how many red flags does it take to prove this to be an obvious stolen card racket? using a card to purchase gift cards is a way that scammers can try to cover their tracks. 

all retail employees should be trained on what to do in a situation like this. please read up on it. please educate your employees and tell them how to manage the situation per your company policies.

i'm working to recover several hundred dollars because a retail employee either didn't care or wasn't trained on how to decline a purchase like this."
"honors society scam so to explane why i'm making this post i'm a senior in high school that has a pretty decent gpan (3.43) and have recently gotten a email from a ""honors society"" stating that i have made their requirements and have been offered an invite, the only thing that needed to be done was create my account pay the fee. i'm pretty familiar with the fact that certain honor societies require a fee to be made every year but this is where the red flag starts up;  i needed to pay $60 subanually for membership/benefits. which is unusually high considering that the one in my local university charges only $50 (or don't have a fee) annually according to my older sister. what makes this more of a scam is that when i searched their name in the official association of college honors societies not only did it not appear on their list of legitimate societies they have links in the home page of credited news articles online that have stated that honorsociety.org (the site that i received the email from) was a scam and to not trust them. it was then that the support chat had popped up and somewhat upset i had messaged them with the evidence that i had found. they sent me two links proving ""legitimacy"" both being links to where you can donate to. at this point i was contemplating just leaving the chat before realizing that they had mentioned having a bbb rating and suprise suprise i get several ratings and comments that they had been taking money from former members that had left the society without their permission despite asking for their fees to be waived. their simply called ""honor society"" and if any college or high school sudents get the email to simply block them as spam and don't trust them. i don't know how many people got the same email but i hope that this post prevents more people from getting scamed."

"doctor's office calling company receptionist? i am a receptionist and i see a lot of calls that straddle the line between sketchy telemarketer and outright scammer. a few scammers eventually get the message after some unsuccessful tries, but there's one persistent scam that i'm having trouble telling off for good.

it tends to go like this:

**them: i'd like to speak to \[employee\].**

**me: what is this call regarding?**

**them: i have some medical documents.**

**me: it's not appropriate for the company to be involved in this. please use a different method of contact for your patient.** 

and then we have some excruciating back-and-forth as they ask repeatedly, ""is this \[company\]? can i speak to \[employee\]?"" before they hang up. these calls can take nearly 2 minutes. it wastes my time and puts me in a bad mood, and i need to be a smiling office manager/front desk face.

i try to take these scammers at face value since it's bad form to accuse them of illegal activity, but it pings all of my scam alarms to think that someone would go to a doctor's office and provide the front desk phone line for their place of work, and not a cell phone or home landline. my office has 100 employees, globally we have 500+, and very rarely does the caller give the name of an employee seated with me.

i'm worried that the only solution is to hang up the instant they mention ""medical documents"" but that kind of breach of etiquette does not come naturally to me. does anyone have any strategies for letting scammers know you are a 0-reward target and they should stop bothering you?"

"scams with spelling mistakes i have heard that obvious spelling mistakes are away for scammers to ""filter out"" the more intelligent (i.e. susceptible to ignore, counter-scam, time-waste) potential marks.

hi jack, it looks like you bought my lumineers tickets. i tired to transfer them through ticket master but am currently in egypt and will not allow me to (i’m guessing it has something to do with the ip address). anyway, i’ll be back in the states on monday and can transfer them then if that is okay with you. sorry for the inconvenience and if it is an issue please let me know. i could try to find someone back home to access my account sooner.

the email looks fairly legit, it is an american first and last name @gmail.com. i haven't responded yet. it *seems* unlikely that this would be a scam as stubhub surely would simply refund my purchase price if anything came up -- just wanted to check here to see if anyone is familiar with anything like this."

it's just every time i talk to these people over the phone, they are super vague, asking a million questions and saying they just need to know how to match me to one of the many different types of businesses. i keep asking for examples but they don't want to say anything until i can talk to one of their consultants.

then i serched (joycelumeta) and found out that someone had recived an email from that person and that is a total scam. and aperantly it is cause then joyce send me the exact same email not a word was diffrent from the one i found online.

"" hello my dear,my name is mrs joy veline lumeta from philippine. i am a sick woman who has decided to donate what i have to charity through you. you may be wondering why i chose you but someone has to be chosen. i was diagnosed with cancer about 2 years ago, immediately after the death of my husband who had left me everything he worked for when he was working in our embassy for nine years before his death. i am suffering from a long time cancer, which also affected my heart.my husband and i are christians, but quite unfortunately, he died by poisoning. i will be going in for an operation, and i pray that i survive the operation. i have decided to will / donate the sum of $4.5 million united state dollars to charity through you for the good work of the lord, and to help the motherless, less privileged and also for the assistance of the widows.i inherited a total sum of $4.5 million dollars from my late husband this money which is concealed in a metallic trunk box is deposited with a security and finance company here in cote d'ivoire this deposit was coded under a secret arrangement as a family treasure. this means that the security company does not know the content of this trunk box.presently, i have informed the security company about my decision in willing this trunk box to you. i wish you all the best and may the good lord bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the good work to others. if you are interested in carrying out this task, i will kindly want you to write me back for further direction and on how to carry out this task.i know we have never met you but my mind tells me to do this with me and i hope you act sincerely.thanks, ""

this person targets artist for some reason cause the other person that recieved this email is an artist also (3d) and his post is here at reddit. in other words if you recieve an email from joycelumeta or joyvelinelumeta (avelinezuhooaa@yahoo.com) dont resond its a scam."
so what exactly is the scam here? what do they get out of this? 
"possible phishing on okcupid? every once in a while, i'll get a message on okcupid. as sad as it sounds that's kinda a red flag because i've never been messaged first on a dating app by anyone who didn't want something from me. 

usually, we will talk a bit, their english might not be the best but there's a large mexican and filipino population near me so that's not an immediate worry. they give short generic answers. then, after a stupid short amount of time, they ask if i can talk somewhere else.

 they always push for google hangouts and say they don't have snapchat, discord, or kik. when i send my google hangouts name, which is my first name followed by just ""lastname"" instead of my real last name, they unmatch. that's why i'm thinking this is a phishing thing. they get your full name from google hangouts.

 it could also be sextortion. they could ask for videos, find people you know irl online using your full name.

if you're using dating apps. just be careful. don't give people your full name and keep your face out of your dick pics"

"manual credit card authorization fraud i mentioned this scam over in r/talesfromthefrontdesk and someone said i should post it here. hi there!

so there i am, working the night shift at a hotel. a couple come in. they haven't got a reservation, but they're tired and they've been driving all night. no problem, we have availability, can i get a card please?

oops, problem; the card is declining.

do they have another form of payment? a debit card will be fine, as long as it- nope, that's declining too.

the gentleman swears up and down that there's enough money on the card, and they're tired and can't drive anymore and mom is in the hospital.

while he calls his bank to straighten things out, i'm getting an odd vibe from the pair. not quite 'sketchy', but something about them isn't sitting right. they're being just a smidge too... something... and repeating they've been driving all night and mom's in the hospital and they just can't go any further... wait a minute - isn't the address on their driver's license only twenty miles from here? yeah, something is up.

after a bit, he hands me the phone. it's the bank. they explain that while the gentleman has enough money in his account, he has exceeded his maximum amount of withdrawals for the day. however, the bank is willing to provide a one-time authorization code for the charge.

**this is a scam.**

what they are doing is relying on the manual/voice authorization process for credit card readers. basically, it is a backup system, where if your card machine will not communicate with the issuing bank or card company, you can call in to confirm sufficient available credit. the issuing company will give you a manual code to reference the exchange, and you can punch that in to your card reader.

the trick is, you can give the card reader literally any code and it will still work. after all, it's just a reference number, not an actual authorization code.

so the scammers just call someone who can sound like a bank employee, using an 'office background noise generator', give a random number, and the card will appear to work fine. it isn't until the credit card batch is run the next night (after they've checked out) that the discrepancy will be shown. someone unfamiliar with the process wouldn't even know they'd been had - ""oh, cool, i didn't know it could do that!"" add a sympathetic story, so someone is inclined to try and help them.

i realize this is likely what's happening, so decide to test it:

""so to confirm, this is for the card ending in 1234?""

""yes sir, that is correct, the card ending in 1234.""

*gotcha*. the *first* card was the one ending in 1234. the debit card being called about ends in 5678. no bank employee would make that mistake.

""ah, unfortunately the system is asking for a manager's override code. i cannot proceed with a manual authorization without that."" (spoilers: it isn't.)

""please hand the phone back to mister smith.""

there is some discussion, a final last entreaty because they're tired and mom is in the hospital and they can't drive any more (reminder that they're locals), but i tell them that manual authorizations can only be done by the manager. he'll be in tomorrow at 10 am.

defeated, the scammers shuffle off into the night. maybe they just wanted a free room. maybe they were planning on using it for drugs or prostitution. whatever the reason, they're not going to be doing here.

teal deer; if someone's 'bank' wants you to run a manual authorization, the answer is 'no'."

"reserved a hotel. scam? reserved a hotel

i don’t know if this the right place to ask but i need help? :(

so recently i reserved a hotel with my girlfriend on booking.com; however, apparently the hotel we reserved only does payments in person. 

although it says we reserved the hotel on the actual hotels end; booking.com is trying to take out the money for the reservation which shouldn’t be happening because we obviously have to pay in person. the money is currently in my girlfriends bank account but is “pending,” the money the hotel was worth. 

should i be concerned whether booking.com will scam me or take our money? we have to pay in person so if booking.com takes our money we’re fucked. does anyone know whats going on or has any idea or some sort of help? please?"

"i got got. any advice? alright. this is the first time this has ever happened to me. i am usually pretty good about catching scams, but i guess these people are pretty good at it. they got me. the website seemed legit. the order confirmation even seemed legit. everything did, until i saw at the bottom the email was saying if you had questions, to email some weird ass email. that’s when i knew. i looked up the cat tree i had ordered and saw that a bunch of people had ordered it off of other websites and either got nothing, or some bullshit half ass cat tree that isn’t even similar to what we all ordered. well i emailed them all, i went back to the website (that had 100% money back guarantee on it!) and the whole website has been taken down. i am not sure what to do, because i have never been victim of a scam before. i don’t know who or where to report it, how i can get my money back, or what to do at all. someone help! lol"
"mom fell for the most obvious scam- can i get them back? i know this will all sound obvious but i just got to my mom’s house and she told me this story about how she bought a car and my heart sank with every detail she told me. i really just want to vent my frustration that my mom was so easily taken advantage of with multiple people warning her.

1) a woman is a dr in the marines and is being deployed for a year and wants to get rid of her 2010 honda with 72,000 miles for $1400 because it belongs to her husband who died four months ago 🙄 “she” also offered to pay for free shipping even though her daughter is supposed to be in our city?

2) they told her she had to buy gift cards in cash. she went to target and they warned her it was a scam but went along with it when she showed them the email. she bought 14 $100 cards.

3) she called a number provided by the email (ebay@customer-services-online.com) they told her it was real. she didn’t google ebays customer service number herself.

4) she took pictures of the cards and emailed to the people 

5) the email was hotmail, the lady’s phone number was google voice, and the customer service line rang, beeped, and clicked off.

6) the case id# was ten digits, real ebay item numbers are ten digits 

7) when she talked to the woman briefly on the phone, her accent was so thick she couldn’t understand it 

so many other details that just shocked me that she’d believe it. she almost got scammed three years ago when someone on craigslist wanted her to send money through western union because they were a missionary already in africa who wanted to rent a house. they said theyd mail her the house keys.

she wouldn’t listen then that it was a scam then either but luckily we drove by the house and the people who currently lived there were able to tell her, sucks that she wouldn’t take my word for it then or listen to my dad and the target employee today and just went ahead with it.

wouldn’t listen to the real ebay customer service specialist either when he told her she was scammed. a sad learning experience but hopefully she’ll be more tech savvvy now.  

i can’t think of how to fuck with them back but all i have is a hotmail email and 

i guess all i can do now is call target and let them know an employee sold my mom 14 gift cards with cash? i know they tried to warn her but they fell for the email too and figured it was real. idk what else to do but i guess if the employees are trained better they’ll prevent it from happening to someone else?"

"packages i didn’t order or pay for? hey there! today i got home to find two packages addressed to my father. it had his full name and our address, but his email address on one of them was definitely not his email. (@mailboxt.net)??

anyway, i was suspicious. my dad got home from work and opened the smaller of the two packages. it was labeled as an iphone xs, though from one of those very obviously fake sellers. the note inside the package claimed that it was an ebay order. even stranger that my dad doesn’t have an ebay account. that’s where the strange email was too. the company was buyspry.  a little digging told me the “phone” was ~$600 and of course a lemon. we didn’t open the packaging and my dad is planning to call the company tomorrow. 

weirder still, the second package. it was lucky brand black women’s boots, size 7. they sold for about $100. weirder still, but maybe just a coincidence, i had been looking for black boots and i happen to be a size 7? odd. there was less information on this package. both were shipped from fedex

it would be more understandable if my dad found these charges on his account, but looking back to the date the ebay phone order was placed (which was on the note) and even further back, my dad found no charges he didn’t make. nothing even close to a $600 charge and nothing he found out of the ordinary. i understand his name and address are public demand, but i don’t understand why anyone would send him random boots and a fake phone? but they wouldn’t have anything to gain, considering they took no money out of his account. 

is this a scam? should we be concerned? any help would be appreciated!"

last week i jokingly retweeted a tweet from a man saying he was giving out money to college kids because he was trying to help people. i retweeted it mostly joking but get messaged by him soon after. he gave me his what’s app &amp; told me that to get the money i needed to give him an ebay gift card. at this point i knew it was fake but i went along with it because i wanted to know what was going on. 

i gave him a code for an ebay gift card for a super low amount (this sounds dumb looking back but i just had to confirm he was a scammer). so obviously he says the gift card didn’t work &amp; wants me to get more. i called ebay &amp; he used the gift card yesterday. 😂 

this leads me to now.. he gave me an email to send the gift card to &amp; the email wasn’t his name. it’s a woman’s name actually.  i have his what’s app number. i have the twitter account &amp; that’s all the real info i know. 

im not worried about getting the money back. i mainly did it just to confirm my suspicions.  my question for you is who do i report this to with such limited information?  also is there anything i can do with the email address?? it’s obviously a real email connected to them if that’s where they wanted me to send the gift card to.

"possibly being scammed. any help is great. have been looking for a job for some time, looking for the right one. was recently contacted by union freight lines, llc about a job offer that would be in my state and in line for my qualifications. pay is good, benefits good etc. supposedly based out of zurich and expanding into the us. 

i was told there would be 4 weeks of training studies with a test at the end of each week. those who finished the training would receive payment as a 1099 for $2700. those who did well would receive double the amount and receive a job offer and training the following week at headquarters. 

everything has seemed to be pretty good and the training has been fairly simple. no real red flags that i knew about at the time. 

i have since checked for any business filings for the company in new york and get nothing. ok, no problem, they’ve only been in the us for a short time. i look up the address of their zurich location and can’t find anything either. found a singular registry for a company with the same name based in california registered to an apartment complex in sacramento. 

i’m starting to think the company doesn’t exist nor that the job offer is legitimate. this would be a step up and better job for me, but i’ve mistakenly fallen for one scam over a decade ago when i tried to buy a monkey online and it has me on high alert. part of me is so enraged at the thought of people scamming someone who’s just trying to find a job.  i mean, a monkey, sure, scam away. /s but mess with my livelihood? seems way worse.

"tdi electric supplier scam? hey all! i just got a knock at my door from a fella who worked for a company that sold energy supply through your delivery service. he was nice, professional, and it all made clear sense what his goals and intentions were. 

basically it works like this: my electric company has a rate that changes every 6 months, and what this company does is offers a fixed rate that can be renewed every six months. the reason the rate changes every month is because the energy delivery service (from my knowledge) will choose an energy supply company for you if you choose not to shop for one.

not to disclose whether or not i took the bait, the gentleman offered me a job as a door to door salesman who would be offering these fixed rates to anyone who wanted them. it actually sounds like a decent gig and id be very interested in sales. 

i looked up tdi on the internet and it has poor reviews, mainly because the salesman themselves were lying to close sales. the fella who arrived was honest and didnt claim to be anything or anyone he was not. the gentleman actually mentioned that he had to recently let some people go because they were not practicing honest salesmanship (i.e lying about the company they worked for) . 

my question is, do any of you have any experience with this sort of thing? is this a scam? would i be scamming people if i pursued a career in this field? the money doesnt seem too crazy to be true (its all comission based) but i also wouldnt feel good if i was ripping people off. any insight would be helpful. thanks"

yesterday i recieved an email saying i had changed the password to my netflix account. confused, i clicked a button on the email for support but thought, better not and went on my phone's app instead. i tried to log on to my account but it kept telling me there was no account connected this specific email. on the app i called a customer service hotline which helped me figure out what happened. 

the account was hacked and this person basically took over the account. not only did they change the password  but the email as well. they assured me any form of payment was secured as they hold it on a different server. the agent asked for the last eight numbers of the card on the account to verify it was me and we were able to change it back to my original email and change the password as well.

has this happened to any of you? if so, considering they have payment information on different servers, what do you think was the end motive of this person? should i still be worried that my card information has been breached?

"is my sugar momma a scam? hello, so a question... i recently started becoming a sugar baby to a 51 year old, and we started chatting and she asked for my kik which i gave. i know her first name but her last name doesn’t show up if i reverse search her on facebook or on google. she started my allowance at $400, she asked for my bank info which i did stupidly, but than i quickly changed my username and my login password, so she can’t get into it. 
    
and she says she lives in havana cuba, and wants to come see and she asked me to get a hotel, which she will pay me, but i decline it. and than after few more minutes, she texted saying “forget my money i submitted to you.” which to me i’ve looked up, and got some definitions one was “to yield oneself to the authority or will of another: surrender.” or “to defer to or consent to abide by the opinion or authority of another.” she i be weary about this, cause i don’t know if she’s planning something and she wants to come see me, friday. but not sure if i should be weary of it."

does this seem scammy or legit? 
"right c3’s questionable business tactics literally doing a simple google search and you’ll find countless reviews and articles about this scam. i was stupid enough to trust the letter i had revived inviting me to this workshop i never even researched this company. 

my story and why this company is still running even after countless complaints:

i received a letter from this company that made it seem like my school sent this out. this company offers help with school and your journey with applying to colleges. we went to the workshop which was held at a hilton hotel. they gave their little presentation and made it sound amazing and it got me intrigued. they called each family one by one privately (slight red flag but i’ll get to that later) to discuss the plan. we sat down with this nice lady (really good salesperson) as she spat out lies that completely went against what the contract actually said. that’s when she threw the bombshell that was the price to all of this. over $2000 paid in payments of $38/week for a year and a half. this lady told us it was once a month not per week. i was still convinced it was worth it while my parents were a bit hesitant. (i even joined on convincing them)

my parents said they wanted to think about it and the lady told us that the window to sign up was gonna close the next day (red flag #2). that’s the same excuse that has been given to other people that complained about this company. they pretty much pressure you into making the decision right away leaving no room to really think about what it is you’re getting yourself into. the lady said we could cancel anytime over and over again. btw my parents don’t speak or understand english all that well and she didn’t even bother getting them a translator when there was one right next to us. the whole thing was rushed just so we could sign the contract and get on with it. 

now to the contract. remember when i said we were told we could cancel anytime? well after my parents realized that paying for this was a burden to them financially and they weren’t expecting to be charged so often, they wanted to cancel (this was 3 months after we signed up)   that’s when we find out they give you three days from your first transaction to cancel. that is not enough to get a feel of a program. i emailed them an angry letter and they called me today to offer to extend the payments. instead of paying $38 a week for a year and a half, we’ll be paying $76 a month until november of 2021. idk how that’s supposed to make it better. we don’t want to continue giving these people money. 

red flags i got from other reviewers:

schools send out warnings against this company

letter makes it seem like it’s free. it’s just a ruse to get you through the door

hyped it up. it was literally just a sales pitch

they pressured you to make a decision that same day

letters gave the impression that a teacher or school sent them



they may be a legit business but they charge a crap ton for their services and make it impossible to get out of.

"is this a product testing scam? found an add on facebook to product test a microphone. clicked the button which led to an automated messenger conversation allowing you to pick between 2 microphones. the company is @freeproducttesting on facebook. 

to get the product they ask you to 1. find the product on amazon and send a screenshot to ensure correct product. also a profile screenshot. 

2. after they confirm buy the product from amazon and provide them the order i'd and paypal info. 

3. after 5-7 days leave a review on amazon. and after the review is up they will send the reimbursement within 24 hours. 

my concerns are that there seem to be a few typos and that they don't have a real website just a facebook page. 

other things that make me more likely to believe it's not a scam is they have about 1000 likes on their fb page and the number of reviews on their fb page seem to be from real people with accounts older than the facebook page.

"did they get my creddit card info? so i got this email where they told me that i needed to pay a fee for a package which got the wrong direction. i am waiting for a package so i though: well dumb me got the wrong direction, they probably got this email fron paypal  since the one i submitted was written incorrectly so i couldn't receive any emails about it.

i submited the numbers on front of the debit card and on the back. till here normal, but then they asked for the numbers that you put on the machines when you buy physically, so i excited quickly the site suspecting it was a scam. i even started receiving sms from my bank telling me the code for the apple pay account that was about to be created(i don't use apple products)

yes i am a dumbass and went this far even having watched many videos about scams.

my question here is if they can get the money from my card since i only submited the front and back numbers (and the expiration date). the card is new, and i just received it last week."

ok just got this one. so should i touch the link?

"my mom got tricked this weekend my a scam that was new to me just figured i would share since this isn't something i have seen before:

my mom got what she thought was a typical chase fraud text ( the did you make xxx transaction one).  she responded no, and got an incoming call ""from"" the number on the back of her card. they managed to sound legit and got her to provide her pin to them (obviously that was a mistake), and then kept her on the phone, as well as telling her her account was temporarily frozen, and she couldn't access her online acct.  

well, immediately after she hung up she realized something was wrong, called the actual chase fraud department, and they scammers were in the process of draining her accounts.  she has managed to get everything sorted, but that was a really good scam, so i thought i would give a heads up about it.  

i also explained things like spoofing to her and she got her account closed and a new one opened to block everything forwardly, but by extracting her pin they were able to cause a large amount of damage *really* fast.  they made several $1 transactions with $100 cash back."

"e-mail scams from joyce so the backstory is, i am an illustrator and 2d animator. i have an acount at asrtstation with my email registered and one day someone named joyce send me an email telling that they saw my artstation profile and would like to talk to me about a project in the making..

"" hello,

i hope you are doing great!!i saw your profile in ( [www.artstation.com](http://www.artstation.com/) ) and i decided to use this means to inform you of the project i have at hand, ofwhich would like you to be a part. could you please respond back before i go further. ""

i answered;

"" hello joyce,

thank you for your interest. i am very interested to learn more about this project. ""

then i serched the name (joyce lumeta/ joyveline lumeta &lt;[joydakumm1@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:joydakumm1@yahoo.co.uk)\&gt;) and found out that someone had recived an email from that person and that is a total scam. and aperantly it is cause then joyce send me the exact same email not a word was diffrebt from the one i found online.

""  hello my dear,my name is mrs joy veline lumeta from philippine. i am a sick woman who has decided to donate what i have to charity through you. you may be wondering why i chose you but someone has to be chosen. i was diagnosed with cancer about 2 years ago, immediately after the death of my husband who had left me everything he worked for when he was working in our embassy for nine years before his death. i am suffering from a long time cancer, which also affected my heart.my husband and i are christians, but quite unfortunately, he died by poisoning. i will be going in for an operation, and i pray that i survive the operation. i have decided to will / donate the sum of $4.5 million united state dollars to charity through you for the good work of the lord, and to help the motherless, less privileged and also for the assistance of the widows.i inherited a total sum of $4.5 million dollars from my late husband this money which is concealed in a metallic trunk box is deposited with a security and finance company here in cote d'ivoire this deposit was coded under a secret arrangement as a family treasure. this means that the security company does not know the content of this trunk box.presently, i have informed the security company about my decision in willing this trunk box to you. i wish you all the best and may the good lord bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the good work to others. if you are interested in carrying out this task, i will kindly want you to write me back for further direction and on how to carry out this task.i know we have never met you but my mind tells me to do this with me and i hope you act sincerely.thanks, ""

this person targets artist for some reason cause the other person that recieved this email is an artist also (3d) and his post is here at reddit. in other words if you recieve an email from that person joyce lumeta or joyveline lumeta &lt;[joydakumm1@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:joydakumm1@yahoo.co.uk)\&gt; dont resond its a scam."

"am i being scammed by a house wife? minding my own business shopping today at nordstrom rack when i was approached by a woman in her mid forties i am female, 23. 

she said it looked like i was “having fun” because i had a couple pairs of shoes in my basket. so we got started talking...

i’m not sure how we even got on the topic, i mentioned how i had recently moved to this city and started a new job last week. somehow the conversation turned into her telling me how her and her husband/kids moved from another state to my current state because they just “needed to do something different”. they met with a couple apparently while opened their eyes to all the different ways to be successful aside from a corporate 8-5 type of job. she mentioned this couple also had a daughter who had planned to go to college but instead said daughter (24) started working for her “parents company” and is “pulling 6 figures working around 20 hours a week!” 

the woman continued talking to me about how important it is to have an entrepreneurial mindset... blah blah blah. she was really pretty/cute and friendly so as the conversation went along she said she would be happy to share more “info” with me about the way these “people think and do business”. at the time i had just enjoyed our conversation so much... so when she asked if i wanted to get together for coffee this coming week so she could explain more about these people and “how they think” i said yes of course! 

i shared with her my cell phone and we plan to meet tomorrow evening after i get off work. i feel there are many red flags in this scenario as i look back on the conversation. but it felt like she was just someone who could be a good contact for me to have? 

i’m curious to see what reddit folks will think of this interaction i had today. and... do you think i should cancel this meeting with her tomorrow? thanks in advance for reading."

i recently purchased a device through swappa for a smartphone with a price that was probably too good to be true (at least in it's ""mint"" condition). anywho, the seller kept procrastinating with selling the device since it was sitting in pre-shipment mode through usps for five days. she claims that an employee of hers was diagnosed with  the coronavirus and stating she couldn't go into her office (this was after swappa staff had to reach out to her) until the next day. friday comes around and the item was still in the pre shipment mode.

i ended up filing a claim through paypal since it had been an entire workweek without her sending the phone at all. should i file a claim against swappa if i already requested a full refund through a seller? and how likely is it that a full refund would be entitled to me? 

one thing i learned form this experience: never buy devices from a new seller with no stars next to their name. 

any advice would be appreciated!"

confessions of a call-centre scammer 
"playing it smart so recently i have been faced with an in-person “scammer”. basically the story is:

i have an apple watch series 4 for sale on the book of faces. my asking price was $460, i got an offer for $400, i said deal. 

then this lady starts giving me red flag vibes. asking about the details of the watch *after* she had agreed to a price and pickup time. she also keeps asking if i can do $380 which i say no to because i’m already getting it delivered to her in the city. 

i ended up having to send my fil to do the exchange because i fell ill. it worked out because he was going to the city that day anyway. 

so i set up the meet up place and time for the two. she walks in, hands fil a ball of crumpled bills, and while fil tries to count them, she grabs the watch from behind him and ran off. she only left $380. 

so fil calls me, he feels bad. i told him not to worry about it because she’ll be messaging me soon. he asks why? 

i didn’t full deactivate the watch. i told him to be sure to count the money first and then if it was all there i’d send him the password and instructions to reset it. 

sure enough, by the end of the day, the lady is messaging me about “how sorry she is” “her daughter deleted the messages of me telling her that she’s short” and “but it’s locked, can you message me your apple id info?” 

i laughed. bitch no i’m not going to give private info to you. i told her if she’s sorry, she can meet my boyfriend in the city tomorrow after his course is done with the $20 and then he’ll unlock it. she agrees. 

well today she’s messaging me like “i have church until 4:15 can you just leave the apple id password in my mailbox???” i told her no, she’s not getting any personal info, she can leave church early or text bf to make a plan. then she’s like “can he meet me at my house it’s addressed at (most dangerous part of the city)?” no once again. 

i told her, had she not run away after scamming an old man, she wouldn’t be dealing with this issue, so it’s her responsibility on how to fix it. either way i feel like bf and i win. she either gives the money owed so she can use the watch, or she doesn’t show and gave us $380 for something she can’t use. 

tl;dr: had a feeling a lady was going to scam me, so i made sure to set up a plan to insure i got full price for my watch. the plan worked."

interesting... 
just got this and it looks fishy... thoughts? 
"mobile phishing scam hey guys just want to give you a heads up on this one.

i got an email and phone call from someone claiming to be bank of montreal.  they provided bogus phone numbers that were obviously fake.

just to make sure i attempted to call the bank from the number on the back of my card.  this led me to a chinese voice message.  i don't know how they did this but when i dial a legit number it takes me to the fraudsters.

i figure my phone is hacked and may have to be restored to factory settings.  any other tips for me?  i can't get into my bank till tomorrow when they are open to warn them."
this getting sent by pm 
is this a scam?? so i met someone over snapchat and he is insisting to use my bank to wire money into it and withdraw the money and claims we'll split the money.. he's saying it could range from 10k-15k and he is saying he does this with a lot of people.. is this a scam of some sort or like is it illegal??

"$1000 walmart gift card hey all, i responded to a facebook post offering a $1000 gift card to walmart. now they messaged me they would like my mailing address to send it to me. whats the worst that can happen if i give it to them?"
"got an email a couple days ago asking if i was related to a person who had died and said that i was to claim the inheritance. i made a post the other day but some reason the mods removed it. the email then said this. i appreciate your response to my initial message; i also apologize for the vagueness of the message as i did not want to reveal much information if you were not the intended recipient. my name is ------------ --------- counsel with the firm asv law in london. the late mr. ------ whom i represent, passed on in a car crash on the 15th of march 2014. mr. ------ was not married neither did he have children, he moved to the uk from the united states as an orphan. the deceased was successful as a petroleum oil investor and did business around europe and other south american nations.


the deceased did not have a will drafted before he died. when a person dies with no will, the probate court allocates the person's assets to his or her next of kin. this is known as the law of intestate succession, and it outlines the allocation mix between surviving spouses, grandchildren, siblings, parents, aunts, and uncles. the aim of the bank is to give the assets to a member of the deceased lineage instead of confiscating it. i have access to essential and mandatory legal documents, that would entitle you the legal right to claim these funds from the bank as you have the same last name and i was recommended by you.

 

the claim will be executed under a legitimate arrangement here in the uk, i will represent you in all probate court sittings. my job is to make sure you receive the benefits within due time and guide you through this whole process. success is guaranteed if you cooperate loyally with me, remember we are following due legal process so there is no way to make the process faster. you will not pay any fee to me; you will only pay me 30% of the benefits when you get it. if after reading this message and it is well understood by you do let me know. i will be inclined to give you the contact information of the financial institution where the funds are lodged and advice you on the way forward. 

 


hope to hear back from you soon,

 


respectfully. 






any idea on what this is ? if its legitimate i need to tell the person that i'm not the intended person so they know."

"my girlfriend is very dumb my girlfriend received a dm on instagram earlier today about someone wanting to be her sugar daddy. he said he was from spain and wanted to give her $6,000 to just talk to her every now and then. all she had to do was get $250 in steam gift cards in order to activate the prepaid visa card she got. she thought this was perfectly normal (idiot lol) and decided to do it without asking me. obviously, it was a scam. i wanted to know if there was anything she could do to potentially retrieve the money. the cards were already redeemed so i'm not expecting anything, but any advice would help!"

"how to identify a scam from a real job on indeed and linkedin? i graduated college in the summer of 2018 and was ecstatic to receive a phone call by a sales office in new york city regarding my application i had submitted on linkedin. the day of the interview i was hired and i really thought it would be my big break but, boy, was i wrong. i was tricked into the manager’s and “team leader’s” motivational speeches and stories. i found myself working long hours doing door-to-door sales in low-income neighborhoods representing an energy company that claimed to save money on electric bills. it took almost a month for my first pay and it was less than $200.. not to mention, the boss paid me via cashapp. i was scammed. i felt so embarrassed and disgusted with myself for being a fool. it turns out the sales office was affiliated with a notorious company called credico. a few weeks later i ended up quitting the job to opt for being unemployed. 

ever since this experience i’ve shunned job posting websites and revolved my job search on word of mouth and official facilities i’ve seen with my own eyes. a week ago my friend mentioned that he found his current job via indeed and suggested i give it another shot (he’s an it at a hospital an hour away). i applied for a job as an insurance verification specialist for a private behavioral therapy company primarily located in tennessee but they have an office a few minutes from where i live in nj. i was interviewed in a small space with cubicles and was told i’d receive a call back by next week. earlier today at my current job my supervisor said she “received the email and will be filling it out.” i was confused. i responded back saying, “what email??” then she explained that a lady had reached out to her about me and was very persistent. 

as much as i want to stay positive about this process i can’t help but think, “what if i get scammed again?” it would honestly put a huge bump in the road if i quit my current job for a potential job that turns out to be a bust. has this ever happened to you or someone you know? how do you know when to trust or not trust certain job postings?"
"headphones scam yes, i have been stupid enough to fall for the price. the headphones were originally $400 but this guy was giving them to me for $150. catch is, he lives in bulgaria. when i bought the headphones from ecrater, he said that they would ship to the us in 20-25 days. idk if that was a red flag but i told him that i want it quicker so i’ll pay for the shipping. he refunded the amount on ecrater to me, and gave his personal bank account information to me. another red flag but i was being optimistic and very very naive. so i paid $170 including shipping. until the day he got the money, he was  pestering me about the money and the day he gets it, he isn’t replying to my emails. i have filed a dispute with my bank but i doubt anything is going to happen because i didn’t go through the website for the transaction. oh another red flag, the link for the product on the website was gone the second i placed the order. another red flag, i kept on asking him how he got them for so cheap and he didn’t reply the first few times but then when i pressed it, he said that he got them for cheap in bulgaria and he can’t say anything more. then i googled it and apparently electronics were more expensive in bulgaria. whole typing this, i’ve realised that this is the dumbest i’ve ever been and that i can be very easily conned and have no financial responsibility. 

to the experts here, is all hope lost? any advice for this would be great. i learnt my life lesson via this scam. 

tldr: sent money to a personal account to buy headphones i was getting a 62.5% discount for in a too good to be true deal.  didn’t get the product, no replies to emails. please help!!"

"weird phone situation today. something weird happened with my phone number. i was w/my gf &amp; left my phone in the car. while we were shopping my phone number called her &amp; it was some recording when we answered it. the weird part when we got back to the car i had a missed call w/ voicemail from a random number but w/ the same recording at the same time she got the call. however, my phone had no outgoing call to her at that time (obviously bc no one was physically with it). what happened? i know what number spoofing is, but this seemed to take it a step further in that the call my phone was receiving was forwarded to her phone via my number simultaneously."

"craigslist impersonation scam? so, i’m apartment hunting. and unfortunately a huge downside to that is having to use craigslist to try and find things. i stumbled across a post that did seem too good to be true, but i wanted to give it a shot anyway. 

here’s where things get interesting. the ad said to include a phone number, so i did. they’d texted me, said they couldn’t show me the property because they’re out of the area, and that they’d send me the keys. red flags, for sure. but i went along with it, to see where it would go. what’s the worst that could happen, right? they emailed me some forms, the name of the email seemed “legit” enough. 

they provided a full name, and an address. so naturally, i looked it up. the person they were claiming to be had lived where they’d “recently moved” for at least the past year, if not longer. also, according to linkedin, they’re a chief marketing officer — with the grammar in the text messages, things really were starting to not add up.

so i pestered them to speak to me on the phone after i bs’ed the “sublease application” they’d sent me. didn’t provide any information outside of a phone number &amp; name really, and everything else was slightly altered. 

got the phone call, and was immediately met with a thick accent. couldn’t place the accent really, but it wasn’t american by any means. and, based on the information i found of the name provided, there was no reason for the person they were claiming to be to not be american. so i asked for verification of identity... and they sent me a drivers license matching the name that was used in the email. and, as soon as they sent it, they asked for a photo of my id as well. no way would i send them that... that’s probably how they got this poor suckers information in the first place, and now they’re trying to do the same to me.

i’m thinking of reaching out to the person they’re impersonating. i don’t know how else to help in this situation, or who to report this to. but it’s clearly extremely fishy. are there any other steps i could take? any suggestions?"

"received random letter from vertex financial group? i'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this or not, but thought i'd start here. i received a random letter in the mail from vertex financial group. as far as i can tell, this is a legitimate company (or at least their websites are pretty convincing) and the letter that i received is trying to get me to refinance a mortgage with them. the kicker of course is that i don't have a mortgage. the letter says that the original lender is nbh bk na (which from what i can tell is nbh bank north america maybe?) for about $300,000. 

normally i'd just throw something like this away, but i'm slightly concerned that there might be a loan out in my name somewhere? i keep a pretty close eye on my credit score and haven't seen anything out of the ordinary. the only other thing that might be relevant is that in the letter, it says that the original loan was taken out in march of 2017. i did move in march of 2017, but i don't have a mortgage. i pay rent in cash to a buddy, so there isn't any sort of official documentation that would imply i took out a mortgage. 

i just wanted to check and see if anyone else has received anything like this. the letter does have contact information at the bottom for the ""mortgage consultant"" who technically sent the letter, so i could try emailing or calling them to get more info. i just wanted to check first to see if anyone else has happened to see anything like this. any info would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"

"scam calls to franchised businesses? (typing on mobile today, i apologize for the weird formatting ahead of time.) 
i work part time in food service for a franchised chain. yesterday in the middle of the afternoon, our stores phone rang, nothing unusual. when my coworker answered the phone, she immediately was bombarded of questions of “can i speak to whoever’s in charge today?” as well as “what do you think of your manager?” with no introduction, or identification, not even a hello. my coworker asked the caller who they were, and who they were calling with. all they presented was a (supposedly) fake name, and skipped over identifying who they were calling with. rightfully creeped out, my coworker ended the call at that point, and we have yet to hear back since. today, our district manager spread news of multiple franchise stores in multiple cities in the area receiving fraudulent scam calls, leading me to believe that the call was indeed a scam. (management for my store verified they had no idea who this call was from, and was not expecting anything like this.)
my question to you reddit, what kind of scam could this possibly be? after they asked us these general questions about how management treats us, would they be gradually leading in to trying to get access to more personal data?

"scammed by prepaid gift cards i purchased a $50 prepaid mastercard in 2016, i made 1 purchase for roughly $20, and left the remaining balance for a rainy day. the card clearly shows the expiration date as july 2020. so i figure i'll use it before then, and it was always in the back of my mind. 

recently i've tried to use the card and it has 0 balance. i call mastercard and they tell me there is a maintenance fees, although i remember checking the card online a few times in months after the first transaction to make sure there are no monthly charges. there ""policy"" is that the charges begin after the first 12 months, so the 13 months onward. if that isn't some deceptive scam artist bullshit, then i don't know what is. the card itself has printed on it: ""funds do not expire."" in fine print. 

here's what pisses me off about this. the card value was $50, and the maintenance fee $3 which starts on the 13th month. therefore the card would only have a balance until (initial 12 months + 50/3) \~29 months after activation at most. then why is the expiration date showing to be 46 months after the date of activation when the balance would be nill and the card useless only 29 months in. not only that, but no where on the packaging when i purchased it did it show anything about a maintenance fee of $3 per month starting on month 13."

"how can i prevent a possible offerup scam? so i'm looking at rather very cheap i would say iphone 11's on offerup.

i've already asked the seller what us wrong with them (if any) and says there isn't. also their official apple brand iphone as i have asked, just to confirm.

i lastly wanted to ask if they are already paid off, but i've done some research and heard how people gotten phones that although were good at first, later had issues because the phone was reported lost/stolen, despite clean imei/esn, for insurance fraud money i believe basically.

is there a way i can prevent this? what would i do to make sure this can't happen to me?"

"need some advice my uncle is caught up in a romance/inheritance scam and is refusing to see this for what it is. it checks all the boxes on every stereotypical scam except that they've met in person.

we're also concerned that this is a green card scam as she seems to be european but claims to have been in the us for 12 years. supposedly she's already proposed so that he can get in on her late ""industrialist"" father's inheritance. 

it's so blatantly preposterous. 

we've spoken with elder services and hope to have a call. he's already sent $1k for moving expenses and has now opened a new bank account for reasons unclear to us. we're worried she's going to take his house and clean out the meager savings he has, and possibly put him in debt through some sort of loan fraud.

he had a stroke a few years ago and we thought he was cognitively all there, but apparently not. it sounds like his sister is his designated healthcare proxy if it came to that.

is there anything we can do to stop this or protect him from her/himself?"
"online ""psychics"" recently created a throwaway email account and signed up for the mugu guestlist.

in addition to the usual &amp; expected nigerian and dating scam traffic, i've been getting a bunch of messages from self-proclaimed internet ""psychics"".

some have a return postal address in usa (wi), some in gibraltar, but what they all have in common is that their spiel is peppered with the phrases ""free"" and ""gift"" everywhere until you get to the end, where they demand a monetary ""donation"" before they will impart their almighty psychic wisdom to you. so much for free.

"weliky macbook seller on ebay i have purchased on ebay a macbook pro from weliky group.  after i had purchased it, i read the really vicious review here on reddit, and i got worried.  [https://www.reddit.com/user/certifiedappletec/](https://www.reddit.com/user/certifiedappletec/) is the reviewer.  more about him later.  my machine works fantastic except the battery is faulty.  when i notified them about the problem, an identical machine was sent out immediately.  i sent back my old one after the new one arrived.  they were very concerned that i was taken care of and very concerned that the machine arrived asap.  excellent customer service. 

&amp;#x200b;

now, about the vicious review by [https://www.reddit.com/user/certifiedappletec/](https://www.reddit.com/user/certifiedappletec/) 

he tells a sad story about an old lady who cries when her macbook, allegedly purchased from weliky breaks.  being a competitor of weliky group, he kindly buys her machine and sells her another.  his review is very lengthy and detailed.  

first, anybody who buys a mac from weliky group  has to know that they are not getting a brand new macbook pro for $1000 or less.  it is explained on the weliky group website and ebay.  they definitely do not claim that they are selling brand new machines.   

i happy with weliky group.  i am a teacher and cannot afford a $3000 machine, but i can afford what i got.  so far so good.  i will continue to update about this item.  

also, [https://www.reddit.com/user/certifiedappletec/](https://www.reddit.com/user/certifiedappletec/) ,  discredits any review that contradicts him, and he continues to post really negative comments.  dude, get a life.  i am sure he will try to discredit this review because i have a new account on reddit.  i joined solely for the purpose of writing a review about my experience.  and i hate bullies.  

i will be honest with my experience.  i wouldn't want anybody to get scammed, expecially not me.  so far, all the negative reviews of weliky group are by this same guy, [certifiedappletec.com](https://certifiedappletec.com).  i would like to here from others who have actually purchased from this company.  

that is all.  have a good day."

"website domain registering scam (dns canada) that i got at work today. we were sent this email at my work this week. i tried googling it and couldn’t come up with any complaints from canada - just one story of a scam using this exact same email wording in ireland.

so i figured i’d put it here, in the hopes that other sceptical canadians will stay safe!

this is a scam! do not pay dns canada or any similar company money to register a domain similar to yours. it is not legit.

for more details on why it’s a scam, read this article from ireland: https://www.internetnews.me/2019/11/13/domain-scam-targetting-irish-small-business/

here is the email they sent, with business and contact info redacted:


dear sir/madam,
 
one of our customers has applied for the domain name www.[yourdomain].net. since you are the owner of www.[yourdomain].ca, we would like to inform you about this registration request.
 
if our customer registers this name, this can have serious implications for your company. it may lead to confusion in google search results because a third party is using the same name. in the worst case, this can even lead to image damage.
 
however, you have the option to register the domain name. as the holder of www.[yourdomain].ca, you have the first registration option with us. in this way, you will avoid any problems with another company operating under the same name.
 
are you interested in this option? here are all the conditions:
- the costs for this name are ca$29.95 per year. we will register this name for a 10-year period, which means that you pay a one-off fee of ca$299.50;
- you can cancel this name after one year, and the costs of the remaining years will be paid back into your bank account. after cancellation, we will refund you within 10 working days;
- we need your company name and address to complete your registration. we will not accept the third applicant and will register the name for you. you can just send this data to me by e-mail
 
this is a non-binding proposal. you are not required to take any action, yet we do recommend that you register this name. this may avoid problems in the near future.
 
if you have any questions, feel free to send your questions by e-mail. if you should like to have www.[yourdomain].net, please send your company details to me by e-mail for your invoice. we will not accept the third applicant and will register the name for you.
 
kind regards,

"my email used to sign up for textnow so i got an email earlier saying that my textnow account will be shut down if i don't send a text soon. i have no idea what this even is, and i'm quite surprised my main email was used, as i am very careful with this one. i have a second one i use if i suspect i might end up on some spamming lists.

so i used the password recovery and logged into this account, i don't know if someone was trying to hack a facebook account or what, but there's just a couple of facebook recovery code texts. this has me a bit worried, but i don't think there are any signs this person is targeting my specifically.

"either weird scam or something worse i met this guy at a conference who invited me to have a meeting with him. he confessed that he owns seven multi-million dollar businesses, owns several start ups, and even prided himself for having a harvard student join his team. however, he still has a full time job which he keeps because he likes the ""company culture.""

i continued several meetings with him 'cause i thought he was legit, but there was always this gut feeling that something was wrong. he never really asked money to ""mentor"" me, but he also demanded a lot of my time. plus, in our meetings, he never really taught me anything - he just liked to talk about himself. he also seems to mirror me (e.g. me sharing an idea and him saying ""oh, ive done that before lol"" and never talking about it again). he takes photos of coworking spaces and says that this is his office that he goes to when he's done with his full time work,  but i found out that the coworking space closes the same time as his full time company.

but the weirdest thing is that he makes these outrageous claims like he met someone from area 51, he worked with a contestant with ms. universe, and got admitted as a professor despite not having a master's degree because ""he has a high iq."" it made me even uncomfortable since he freely and loudly admitted that he lijes serial kills, wants to kill corrupt officials, says he's the smartest and everyone's dumb, and is not afraid to make rape jokes even if i told him to stop it. i decided to do some research on him and found that he doesnt have a linkedin or any social proof that he owns a business. he even refused to share the name of his businesses and directors.

what made it worse was he constantly demanded that i stay away from family and friends because thats what he did when he made his business.

i decided to cut contact with him and told him i'm not interested with his mentoring program, but he still keeps bugging me. thinking of being associated with him makes me anxious because i'm not sure if this is a scam or something else.

i really dont know what hes after and this unknown just makes it hard for me to go outside and do regular things. 

p.s. he knows where i live 'cause he usually walks me home after the meetings. one of my friends suggested telling the police but my other friend told me that i should just keep ignoring him."

 i noticed the lady(wife?) in the passengers seat was wearing some kind of religious outfit. the two teens in the back knew the driver (father?) was begging. i don't normally respond to pan handlers but this sob's pitiful face was awful. so, i gave him some cash thinking he would repay as much as he can, considering the children.  i asked him to write down his number.  he stepped out of the suv mumbled something in a weird accent and then kept offering the rings like i would purchase gold on the street from a stranger!  he said he doesn't use email and wrote down a number way out in md. 

of course he never answered when i called. the driver pulled the old ""gypsy ring scam.""  so, this was carried out by a scam artist out to hock fake gold rings in residential places.  although i'm kind of upset, it made me think of the consequences.  now i'm searching for .gov websites that report bullshit like this.

so i obviously know i’m an idiot. i had someone reach out to me via twitter asking if they could send me money after they bought a concert ticket. i replied saying they had the wrong person. i later jokingly said they could still pay me if they wanted. they replied asking me to text them so they “knew it was me” i texted the number, and it was an actual iphone number. this person then sent me a picture of a venmo card and said they needed to call me because they didn’t want to give the card info over the phone. i was confused as to what they needed me to do, and he said he couldn’t get into his venmo account and needed to pay someone for a concert ticket, and said if i let him use my account i could have the rest of the money on his card. i at all time didnt think it was a scam, because i didn’t give him any of my information, and deleted my personal card (which was an old card anyways) off of the app. so he called me and had me add his venmo card as payment method, to send this other girl money. he needed to send her 930, but venmo only allowed 460. so he had a remaining 460 balance on what was my venmo account. he said he’d call her to tell her he’d send her the rest tomorrow and call me back when he got off the phone. that was two days ago and he hasn’t contacted me, and won’t respond to my texts. but he hasn’t blocked me on his accounts or anything. i got worried it was a scam and didn’t want that venmo account anymore so i transferred the remaining balance and closed the account down. i still have the other $460 hidden in a safe place so if anything happens and i somehow owe that, i will have it. but i’m not sure what exact scam this is, because the whole situation is weird. like i said, i know i put myself in this situation and know i’m an idiot, so you don’t need to tell me that😂🤦🏻‍♀️"

"warning about a scam moving company and my story of what happened my father and i were planning a cross country move from arizona to pennsylvania. we had wanted to hire global vanlines for our move but through some kind of mix up we got ch global vanlines. they blatantly lied to us on the phone. telling us that not only were they the real global vanlines but that they were a moving company. both of which were lies. this company is a broker. that means they subcontract to a random 3rd party company and then stop caring the minute they get paid. they tried to milk as much money out of us as possible forcing us to not take most of our furniture with us. most of the items we took with us were our keepsakes, items we can't replace, our clothes, and other smaller things like that. we had about 30 boxes, 3 chairs, a large desk, a chess table, and 2 lamps.

ch global dispatched a israeli dude and his movers to our house. they were very professional and polite and even did a decent job wrapping up our stuff. we were told it would be at our new house in 21 business days. shortly after my dad and i got on a plane and moved into our new house. we realized our mistake by that point. we contacted lawyers, the federal department of transportation, the police, and anyone who could help us.

we also tried to reach these israelis directly. the lead guy named david, screamed at my dad on the phone saying things like i don't care how many \*\*\*\*\*\*\* times you call here your not getting my stuff!!!!!! we threatened these israelis and ch global with a federal lawsuit with rico charges. 6 weeks after our stuff was taken, it finally arrived at our house. the movers who brought it were ukrainians who were not affiliated in any way with ch global or the israelis. they hadn't even been told what the israelis did to us. we explained to the ukrainians what we had been through and they were appalled and apologized. most of our boxes were flattened and the chairs were badly matted and damaged.

we turned our voicemails and other evidence of the lies and deceit of ch global vanlines over to the real global vanlines and the police. last we heard ch global turned to impersonating mayflower vanlines since global vanlines caught on."
"facebook marketplace scam via paypal/payments. help. so. let's get to the core of the story.

i was looking to purchase a phone as a gift. phone was listed on facebook marketplace. i contacted owner, owner's profile looked legit. owner said he was down state for training with his job. gave details, imei number, etc of the phone. all checked out. said he can stop by the post office to ship it today; as he meant to set the listing up down state and not where i was searching via marketplace.

he requests money via facebook payments. i submit the payment and he states he will message me with a tracking number within the hour. three hours later, the fb profile and marketplace post is gone. 

what are my options. paypal says it was ""a personal transfer"" and that they are non-refundable. i don't know how, but facebook also listed it as a ""non-refundable"" personal transfer. what can i do here? i always figured paypal sided with the buyer. i did not check any ""personal/family"" transfer boxes. paypal even charged me their paypal fee.

"facebook marketplace scammer, no way to report them? he still is online regularly! i wasn't sure which flair would be most fitting so sorry if it's incorrectly matched. i can't believe i never discovered this thread until recently but wanted to warn people of a scammer roaming facebook marketplace that uses fake paypal emails to fool you, and i was the victim of a recent scam and they are still active on messenger regularly. 

back in december i tried to sell a lenovo laptop i barely used and put it up for sale on marketplace, i planned to only sell it locally because i didn't want to bother with shipping fees but a seemingly nice older feller reached out to me and offered me an extra $80 in addition to the $500 starting price. i don't have a job and needed the cash so i agreed and i was getting the ""paypal"" notifications in my inbox right on the spot and they perfectly looked like the official paypal emails. i've been using paypal for a long time so it all seemed normal, and i usually can spot scams since they go right to spam 99% of the time. 

it was a few days before christmas and he specifically requested usps priority shipping, so of course i paid for it since i was promised $580 altogether and ""paypal"" told me the money was processing. i figured paypal is more sensitive dealing with large chunks of money so it seemed normal. long story short the package made it to its destination and the buyer stopped replying to my messages, although read them. i wanted to make sure the package arrived safely, and on new years eve called paypal about the money and lo and behold it wasn't their email and i'd been ripped off.

a lot of stuff happened afterwards and i don't want to say certain things in specific to protect my identity but usps support treated me poorly, paypal doesn't care they are being impersonated, fb has no way to report users and the shipping company it arrived in when it was delivered to ca acted suspiciously too. someone from the uspis came to my home and i told them everything and saved all the emails from fake paypal and the messages from the scammer. he thinks it was a czech shipping scam and was nice, but never got back with me after awhile and stopped updating me. i had to do my own research and investigation on the pathway of the package and compared the faulty info usps gave me when they thought it was still in the country. 

a lot of other things happened but i'm not going to get into specifics for privacy reasons, my main point here is that i want to know how to report him since he's still using facebook messenger regularly and i don't see any way to report him on the website. he doesn't have a fb account, only messenger and its infuriating to see him still operate and be completely free to do as we wants. i just need help trying to properly report him so is there anyone that can help me out?"
"tinder scam! it's very embarrassing but i hooked up with a girl on tinder. she said she's 19 when meeting up and we agreed to hook up. i sent her some money via as a payment via cashapp. 

the next day, her sister added me on social media, tried to get me into another hook up. i agreed and sent her some money in advance. then she proceeded to blackmail me and said the girl i hooked up was her little sister and she's underage. she threatened to send all of my info to cops if i'm not paying her extra money. she said she has photo cause i sent her one photo of my face and all of the chat messages that she saved. 

i blocked her contact and cashapp. though i'm a little bit panic and don't know what will happen next. it is stupid and it is my fault. what should i do now?"

"has anyone come across this romance scam before? first time dealing with a romance scam :( i was on okcupid and i saw that i had a message from this girl name ksenia it read. ""hi alex, thanks for writing, it seems our sympathy is mutual :) how are you having a new year? i can say it very well :) sorry, i’ll answer late, it doesn’t mean that you are not interesting to me, i just don’t have much free time to constantly go to the site and check it. in general, i think that there is too little time in our life to spend it on dating sites. by the way, i'm generally new to this site, i did not expect that there would be such wild activity. all the men here seem to want only sex for one night, as if they broke the chain and they never had sex, even funny huh. in fact, i am looking for a completely different, i hope to build a long-term relationship. i want to find a companion for my life. i am neither a materialist nor a drama. like all i love to enjoy life and try new things, of course crazy in my own way. i can also say about myself that i lead an active lifestyle, and sport is an integral part of my life. i think that it will be interesting for both of us to get to know each other better? if you still have a desire to meet me, then you can write to me at (her email) is my mail. and maybe we can resume our communication there, and no one can interfere. because i'm going to delete my profile, because of frantic activity, i hope you understand. sorry for such a long message, even tired while writing, lol, i just tried to write everything in one message in order to try not to come back here. but maybe i can wait for your answer, because for me it is very unusual and interesting :)""

 so i said what ever i'll play along its probably a scam anyway lol. the first email from her was a little fishy being from russia and the pictures of her looked way to nice to be true lol. but as soon as more and more emails were exchanged and a couple phone calls were had i thought to myself this has to be real right? she said i love you and i want to be with you fast. that's how they get to you. i started asking about video chatting but she got defensive and always had an excuse or never answered the question. then she started asking for 638$ for a visa after only 3 months of chatting but what made me doubt that it was a scam for money, she never said ""i need you to send money"" it was always ""if you can help me that would be great"". just yesterday i decided i would make a couple fake gmail accounts and just say hello to the email in question lol. and i got the same email! like the one in the picture! these scammers are clever if you're not careful they really play with your emotions but i hope no one has to deal with these scams. hopefully this post will help out the next person!"
"the financial scammer people still believe in hey, everybody... my name is radi and this post is about a well known financial guru - robert kiyosaki. it is going to be a long post, but i really need to just write about it... i can't believe the dude has been scamming people for so long and still has such a big fan base... it is unreal. please, protect your money from this man. in this post, i am going to tell you about the lies he writes about in his books. he gives you absolutely terrible financial advise... please be aware and protect your money from him and his company. 

here is a video i made about him if you would like to hear what i have to say instead of reading it :

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t\_ozgboygws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ozgboygws)

so, as we all know, robert kiyosaki claims he started learning about money at the age of 9. his ""poor dad"" advised him to talk to the father of his best friend mike - the so called ""rich dad"". robert tells us about the 2 unsuccessful businesses he started with ""mike"". one of them where they managed to create their own money and poor dad told them it was illegal so they had to stop. and the 2nd one where they opened a comic books library which they shut down after some bullies got into the library and started a fight or whatever. well, there are a lot of problems already with what robert has said...

let me start. first of all, the stories about the 2 businesses he started at the age of 9 with mike - he has admitted that they didn't exist, it was just for the story...

the 2nd problem - mike doesn't exist. he later admitted that his friend ""mike"" is actually called ""allen"". he hasn't provided any proof that allen was actually the character he described in his books, but anyway let us continue...

he has also admitted that his ""rich dad"", the father of his best friend mike/allen, is actually a lot of ""rich dads"". he said he called all of his financial teacher throughout his life ""rich dad"". but wait... around 2016 he posted a video in which he said that a popular businessman in hawaii that had just passed away, was his ""rich dad"". a little bit confusing, no?

it gets even better when you read his claim that the first book he ever posted was his ""rich dad poor dad"" book in 1997 after he got financial freedom with his wife and he just wanted to ""educate"" everybody on the subject of money in his free time. well, not really... his first book was actually released in 1991, three years before his claim that he got his financial freedom... it is called ""if you want to be rich &amp; happy don't go to school : ensuring lifetime security for yourself and your children"". guess what he did with this book? he used it to upsell for seminars in australia!!! and there is actually footage of him on youtube how he talks to a public of australian women about how women are the best in business and how kids shouldn't go to school... yea...

but it gets even worse. robert claims he got rich from his financial education that started at the age of 9 and from his businesses... well, not really. if you look at robert's life it goes like that - at 9 years old met rich dad. started studying with him. graduated, got a job with standard oil. went to the army so he could drink at a bar with beautiful women on an island(in some other books of his he claims he did it to serve his country. but he also claims in some other books that they were brainwashed by the army... make your mind up, robert!!!). then he claims he fought in vietnam, met a vietnamese woman he wanted to buy gold from for a cheaper price. didn't work out and that was one of his ''biggest financial lessons"". yeah... rich dad sent him a letter in which he told him ""the world's about to change"". he gets back home, goes to a real estate seminar course for $385. buys a property that nets him $25 a month... starts to work at xerox as a salesman. leaves the job 4 years later so he can start his own business. goes bankrupt. meets kim. they get together. starts business. goes bankrupt. goes to the basement of some of his friends with kim so they don't have to sleep on the street, because apparently his rich dad isn't a generous dad as well lmao. he and kim start organizing and selling their seminars. (not written in the book, but it happened =&gt;) robert publishes his first book in 1991 and starts selling a ton of seminars in australia. as he mentioned himself - people there had a lot of interest to learn more. robert and kim ""retire"" in 1994(do you seriously believe them? i don't). in 1996 they release the cashflow game. in 1997 rich dad poor dad is released and in this book they upsell you with their seminars and try to convince you to buy their cashflow game. from then on, at least 20 pages in every single book with 2 or 3 exceptions will be dedicated to try to upsell you for a seminar of theirs or their cashflow game. i must admit, it is a really good strategy. but what you learn in there is a scam!!!

***robert's advise on how to invest in stocks***

terrible advice... he claims that the only people who make money from stocks are insiders. in the first version of his ""rich dad poor dad"" book he claims you must find people who are insiders and get information from them about stocks. because ""that is what friends are for""... btw, that is not the only illegal advice he gives you.

anyway, he also tells you about he managed to get a company public on the toronto stock exchange. he claims he got some companies public. he did that, because he managed to find a rich person with probably a fake name who told him how to do it. guess what, what robert tells you is a lie. he got none. zero. zip. nada. companies. public. none.

but it gets even worse. his financial advice about stocks is utterly terrible. he tells you to trade stocks with options. he calls the call and put options which you can buy - ""insurance"". he thinks that if you are not ""insured"" you are an average investor. also, if you can't read charts and use technical analysis, you are an average investor... wrong. wrong. wrong. so, he basically called warren buffett, charlie munger, peter lynch, benjamin graham, seth klarman and many others - average investors. while in fact these are the best investors in the stock market... ever. at first, i used to believe him, because i hadn't yet read books about or from the investors i just mentioned. and all they advise you is to do the opposite of what robert tells you. robert calls you an average investor if you hold your stocks for the long-term. i guess warren buffet is a terrible investor, because he holds his coca cola shares since 1987(he invested $1 billion in coca cola).

***robert's advise on how to invest in real estate***

his advise is based on the financial scammers from the 80s... he advises you to buy real estate with no or juuuuust a little bit money down and then rent it... use amortization and depreciation to get more money that you can use to invest in other properties... look at 100 deals in 90 days... try to negotiate a lower price. based on his examples he offers around 20-30% less of the price that the owner of the property asks for... get yourself into millions and millions of debt... yea, seems a bit sketchy to me, i don't know about you guys.

it is funny, because as robert got asked in the early 2000s to provide an address so it could be checked if he really owned a big property that he is a landlord of, he refused to give and and said he didn't want to, because people would start to think that he is rich. **whaaaaat???**

***robert's advise on how to get started in business***

the advise he repeats again and again is... to get involved into a mlm scheme... he even has a book about that called ""the business of 21st century"". i believe you can find more information about mlm scams on reddit. they are really dangerous, give you false hopes and you have a bigger chance to get rich if you were to work at mcdonalds part time...

&amp;#x200b;

***robert repeating himself in every single book of his(20+ books)***

robert kiyosaki is repeating himself like crazy. it is not just that he is repeating himself in other books. he repeats himself in the same book a lot!!! for example, if you read his book ""fake"" you are going to notice that he used the same 3 graphs with the same explanation to them around 20 times or even more. in a lot of his books you are going to read about the $385 real estate seminar he went on to learn how to invest in real estate. that happened when he was around the age of 26. his rich dad told him he didn't have time to teach idiots. wow. kind of funny, because robert was already for 9 years under his wing from the age of 9 to 18. and still didn't learn how his rich dad invests in real estate which is one of his main ways to make money according to robert... wow. you will also see in each and every book the cashflow quadrant which is basically what e, s, b and i stand for. in each and every single book of his. multiple times in each!!! by the way, it is really interesting how he managed to memorize so many conversations with his rich dad word by word. you are going to read them in every single book, again and again and again and again... you are also going to read the story about how kim started investing in real estate and became a real estate mogul in 5 years... yea, sure... 

&amp;#x200b;

***the end***

thank you for reading this post... there is a lot more that i can say, it is just hard to get it all out at once, because it is a lot of information. there is a lot of sketchy stuff with his ""rich dad advisers"" and their books... may be i will create another video or another post on reddit so i can make a part 2. but believe me, there is a lot more to talk/write about. i am really passionate about this topic, because i noticed that a lot of people still believe robert. and because of him people are making terrible decisions."

"rental listings scam these people are serious scammers, using fake listings from other agents and posting them as their own. they run on ""trust and technology"" as they say. they create a listing, give you a lock box code and have you view the property. they'll pick nice houses and list them for less, so you think 'hey deal'! if you like it they'll ask you to submit your information (including banking info!) and will then shamelessly ask you to submit application fees, rental payments, etc. only you'll never move into that house, since it belongs to someone else. you're out denied application fees ($100) at best, a few thousand at worst. their 'address' is a po box btw. this their website. they are on various listing sites (zillow, trulia, [rent](https://rent.com).com etc.). potential renters beware!!!!

hi ,  


i'm john watson, the property owner you wanted to rent. we are pleased that you have an interest in our house and we want responsible decent adults or family that will manage our house as if it were theirs. my wife and i initially had it up for rent with an agent  that was asking too much from renters by inflating the rental fee, asking for application fee and agent fee, there by making it difficult for people to afford the rent and putting my house off market. so for this reason, i decided to rent it out myself and no longer with any third party, rather a direct agreement between me and any interested renter. i have already instructed the agent to take off the sign post from my property. as you can see our rental fee is below standard this shows we aren't really bothered about the rental fee rather our most priority is your assurance in being able to keep our home in good condition always.  


the reason why our house is up for rent is because i got transferred from my place of work to new york as a robotic programmer. i will be away with my family for at least 5 years or more. you can get back to me if you are truly interested, by telling me more about yourself, your previous rental experience and your move in date. i await your reply asap.  below are more details about my home for rent.  


address: 8514 w edgemont ave phoenix az 85037   
bed room: 3 bath room: 2  
rental fee: 1200  
security deposit: 1000  
pet fee: 200

all paperwork and employment handout and w-2/w-4 will be delivered to you in person by the company representative on the same day of delivery of your working materials, a contract is a legal document. a true partnership is so much more. so the company does not send such documents via the internet.

okay. direct deposit is great and weekly is awesome.  
📷  
i will send you the entire questions through google hangout and you are to send in your answers within a limited time of 15 mins. so you are to answer the questions one after the other, i will attend to your answers when you are done sending the answers to the interview questions. okay ?  
okay.  
📷  
here are the interview questions, your answers should start coming in one after the other as soon as possible.    


1. do you have a job presently? if yes, what position do you occupy with the company?  
2. are you seeking full time/part time position ?  
3. do you have a military background or military status ?  
4. do you have a printer,scanner, photocopier and fax machine?  
5. do you have an idea of how to use ms excel ? what is your typing speed?  
6. what do you understand by privacy and code of conduct of a job while working with a company ?  
7. what do you regard as the biggest challenges and opportunities facing a firm today and how to improve services ?  
8. what are your strengths and weakness ?  
9. what do you understand by disbursement and reimbursements of funds?  
10. when did you have to deal with conflict in the office, and how did you resolve it ?  
yes. i work as a clerk at the post office. i also work as a bookkeeper at another location.  
full time. no military background. no printer, scanner, photocopier and fax machine. i can purchase. regarding excel i have zero experience. regarding typing speed = 35-45 words per minute.privacy and code of conduct are of the utmost importance! challenges facing most companies today are having quality minded employees who would treat the firm/company as if it was their own. customer service with a caring attitude seems to be absolete. take care of people and the firm will take care of its employees. my strengths are compassion towards resolving customers issues with patience and the desire to help. my weakness is that i wish i was younger with the knowledge i have now. disbursement are funds, etc...going out. reimbursement is being paid for something purchased by self. conflict in an office happens to everyone. how we choose to deal with it can impact our happiness and others. patience and choosing to listen to the issues and then trying to provide humble solutions that will benefit all. thinking of others first is key to me. apologies go along way.  
okay i am done.   
lynn i do need to leave in a moment to get on the road to my job.  
📷  
alright mike  
do you have the google hangout app installed on your cell phone?

is this a scam? has anybody else got this?

luckily i dont use this email with my amazon account... so it was easy to know that it's a scam! 
"generationtees.com - fake online store generationtees.com

i lost $50 to this scam operation.

item never arrived. chased it up with them, they asked for order number, i gave it to them and then heard nothing back for a month despite following up again several times.

finally this evening i told them i won’t be contacting them again, and that i would be warning people that their website is a scam.

guess what? got a message back pretty quick that time! 

“please email customer service. i’m just the social media manager. it’s pointless talking on facebook. email customer service”

he left no customer service email nor did i see one on their website. 

we weren’t talking on facebook either... as the “social media manager” he should probably know that.

he’s just trying to buy more time, the whole thing is a scam. 

it’s sad that people are okay with doing this and scary how blatant they can be. i’ve seen a few other scam websites recently too marketed on instagram right there in the feed.

this all needs to get clamped down it’s a joke..."

"at&amp;t fraud/scam? did i fell for it? so i just got a call from an 612 (my area code) number. it was a bot at first, claiming that someone had use my att account to purchase the iphone 11 and had it ship to west virginia. so my account was temporarily halted because of the suspicious activity. the bot told me to press 1 if i don't recognize this purchase. i hit 1 and was automatically transferred to a person. he claims that someone had made a suspicious purchase with my account and sent the phone to west virginia. i told him i don't know anything about that. he then asked me if i usually use public wifi...like at the mall. i said no, and he told me i shouldn't because hackers can easily get people's information that way. he then told me that he will cancel the order and restore my account. he gave me a ""claim number"". then put me on hold for like 20 seconds. then he said he was going to send me a pin number to confirm that i am the owner of the account. he sent me this 4 digit pin to my phone, and i gave it to him. as soon as i gave it to him, he said everything has been taken care of and i don't need to take any further actions. he then hung up as soon as he said that. 

question is, did i fall for a fraud? i didn't give him any of my personal information, but the pin he sent me could've been a way for him to try to verify my identification somewhere. i tried calling the number back, but it was a number to a university. what can i do now to protect myself if this was a fraud/scam?"

"wish.com auctions? i noticed that on the wish app they added this new feature called ""auction"".  it basically works like tophatter (also a scam) except bids are free.

i'm 99% sure it's a scam and they have bots to run up price so you can't just win on low bids.  the items they have are complete junk (like most things on wish), and it's virtually impossible to win an item at a price below what they already charge for it (as far as i can tell).

anyone else have any experience with this?"

i intend to keep posting [my review](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5e5d988c1a916983c3a6d5f0#) and screencaps for as long as it takes until i get my money back or i feel that i've taken more money out of their pockets than they took from mine by dissuading potential customers. i'm not the only one who had this experience either -- [you can look at the 1 star reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.linksnappy.com?languages=en&amp;stars=1) and see that refusing refunds and lying about their customers is a trend for them."

"am i getting scammed by this guy? i received a dm on instagram from a dude on instagram who’s profile is just a lot of pictures of weed. it looks like only a few of the pictures are original. he sent me a message asking how i was and after some small talk asked if i was interested in buying weed. (i am, lol.) at this point i’m already hesitant because how does that even work? it’s not like they’re gonna ship it to me, that’s super illegal. i asked him about prices and he sent me a huge list of great prices and it all looks pretty legit, and when i told him i’m not confident because this all seems fishy he said “most people say that” and i “have nothing to worry about, if you don’t receive your order you get refund.” do i even bother with this guy?"

i really love corgi puppies and there is someone selling some in california. she says mom and dad are pure breed and akc . she is selling them with papers or without (lesser price). the paperwork are to submit that they are purebred. i would get the pup at 8 wks with their shots.

she is asking for $250 up front that is a nonrefundable deposit for the pup. 

i know there are alot of puppy scams out there. how do i know if i'm being scammed?

"need help looking into a company. i’ve been putting out applications for a summer internship required for my advertising degree all over the place. one of the marketing companies in ca got back to me pretty quickly and requested an interview. i told them i’m in school in michigan and wouldn’t be able to make it. they pointed me to their sister marketing company in detroit. i applied, and they got back to me the same day.

innovative client connections
[here’s their website](https://www.innovativeclientconnections.com)

i’ve noticed some minor grammatical errors in their website. nothing completely damning. but i have a feeling that their employment methods seem a bit predatory. [example from youtube](https://youtu.be/steixrpwehw) 

something about that video makes the company seem illegitimate to me. 

despite my gut feeling i scheduled an interview at their office for monday. being an inexperienced college student i’m kind of desperate for any opportunities that come up.

i don’t know much about the marketing industry so i don’t know if this is what a 5 year old company is supposed to look like, or if it’s one of those “pay-to-work” scams."
"my business name is being used by someone to fraudulently charge credit cards. has anyone else experienced this? got a phone call today, from an angry lady in michigan saying my ""website had crashed after she placed her order and now the pages are 'not found' and she wanted to cancel her order right away."" she also let me know she'd called her bank and reported me, and they'd given her my number (i assume they just did a google search).

now the weird part, is i run a small art gallery that helps emerging artists in canada... she'd been on some website (didn't tell me the site), and ordered a ""home and garden credenza"". we sell art...not credenzas.... she gave me an order number which was clearly a shopify order number (they start at #1001 and go up from there. hers was #1008. for us that would have been an order from 2012). 

her name is not in my order history, no money has gone into my bank account, and no trace of her name in any of our payment processing options.

i remember this happening once back around 2013 ish, but not how it was resolved (also a person from michigan oddly enough). 

i got an email from a different person this evening with a similar situation but she didn't say what she'd purchased, or her location. just that money was taken by my website from her account.

tl;dr somehow my art gallery's website is being listed as the business charging people's cards. what do i do to fix/report this?"

i'm like 95% sure this is a scam. the thing is, i've never heard of anything like this before. and i've tried googling it, but the google algorithm only gives me articles about telemarketing scams and fake phone donation charities. i've heard people sometimes want old phones so they can get your personal data. or maybe he just wants to sell it for a quick buck. has anyone ever encountered something like this? and more importantly, how do i convince my mom this is a very bad idea?"

"grandma's answering random numbers hey guys! on mobile so i'm sorry if formatting is off.

my grandmother got a call today from someone claiming to be her preacher. he asked if she was planning her house and when she said no he asked ""so you're just planning on living there alone?"" and she said yes, as long as possible. he then hung up.

her preacher is out of the country currently so we know he did not actually make this call. she lives in a very small, rural area. the church she attends has about 20 regulars and no social presence. she's not listed on anything having to do with the church either. 

any idea what this could be?"

"an old friend tried to blackmail my boyfriend and i out if almost $400  i'm not going to give out any real names.

this whole situation wend from bad to worse. i regret my actions, and i've learned my lesson to share private information about yourself online to people you don't trust, or truly know. 

i'm a 20 year old mom, and at the time was around 17-18 when this whole thing started. while i was dating my ex, ( my daughter's father), i had joined a group chat , where you could share nudes and porn and all that shit. there was this one old man in the chat. i can't remember his name, but he went by turtle on kik. i talked to him most of the time, and he was the main person who saw what i posted to the chat. he claimed that he didn't save the pictures. he also claimed he had women he did sexual things to in his basement, because his wife had physical problems, which made intercourse painful, so they hadn't had sex in years. the nudes is what he got off to. he always gave me compliments, about how good i looked. i exposed him online, warning people about him and what he was capable of. i should have fine the police, but i was scared. 

not long after, i met a girl from canada, that i only by the name of roxanne, who could hack into devices of other people. she was also a good friend of mine. i asked her to remove my nudes because he threatened to post them online. after she hacked into his tablet, we had a falling out, and we lost contact after she made a suicide attempt,and her grandmother told us (my boyfriend and i) to stop talking to her. that was nearly two years ago, and at this same time, i met this man, which i'll refer to as texas, in a kik group chat my boyfriend, wakoya (wah-koi-yah) had added me to. we met roxanne through .

he was basically the outcast of the group, and i felt bad for him. i wanted to be his friend. he told me that he was being bullied by members of the group, so i decided to defend him, which resulted in me leaving the group. he and i became good friends. occasionally i unintentionally didn't reply to his messages because i'm a forgetful person, and i also have a busy life. 

fast forward to this year, texas goes to my boyfriend wakoya, telling him that roxanne and turtle have my nudes, address, and a picture of my face. they threatened to post them online, and send people to my house to rape me. my boyfriend was scared shitless, but i knew the situation seemed wrong. i hadn't provoked or done anything mean to roxanne. i was kind of scared, but still wary of the situation. this was very stressful for wakoya, to the point where he almost killed himself because of it. to ""save"" me, i guess. i told him it would be no use, because i'd be alone to fend for myself, because i was too scared to go to the police about this. i didn't want my mom finding out, because she warned me about people who would do this kind of thing. i didn't want them in danger too. this fear and stress went on for almost two months. texas said in order to get roxanne off our backs, is if we had to pay her $400. my ex (victor; my child's father) told us not to, because of this was real, they would demand more money. during this time, texas made us feel guilty because roxanne had been calling him derogatory names, threatening him, and sent someone to kill him twice. he said he got stabbed in the leg because of it. so, as a way to pay him back for ""protecting me"", i was forced to send him videos of myself. whatever he wanted. i felt like i was being prostituted. it was actually wakoya's  idea, and he still regrets it now.

recently, wakoya  told his parents about this situation, which resulted in the police doing an investigation. they took away wakoyas' laptop, which is what he used to communicate with me, so they could find out if this was real, if my life was in danger, or if it was just a scam. wakoyas' dad felt that it was scam. this was in april. while the investigation was going on, i was still talking to texas. like nothing ever happened. just yesterday, when i was with family, wakoya called me. he got his laptop back, and his dad came home with news. texas had been scamming us the whole time. the messages he showed us were faked. the parts about roxanne and turtle having dirt on me to get revenge, a lie. the stabbing was a lie.  he was just trying to get money from us. the police told his dad that he's been scamming people like this, getting money from them. getting enough so that it's not suspicious.

i was told to block all contact from him, and to not tell him we found out what he was doing. that would be tampering with evidence, i think that's what wakoya said. after i heard that news, i was so hurt. i thought he was my friend, but he used us, too get what he wanted. for a while, he'd been asking me for nudes because he claimed that he loved me.  it was all a lie to get money and nudes from us. 

this experience has been terrifying for me, but now i'm more worried, because this man possibly has videos of me touching myself, and my address. he could ruin my life. i hope the police can get that taken care of. but in the future, i will definitely be more wary of who i befriend online. this was two years ago, and i've been too scared to come forward with this, but now i'm sure i have nothing to worry about. who knows what he could have done if we hadn't done what he'd asked..."

"i left a message with my phone number on a potential scam number. how screwed am i? in my defense, i am exhausted from work, which probably contributed to this. i am an idiot though and i fully acknowledge that. also, as context, my home phone doesn't always work so i use my cell phone when applying for jobs.

i received a call on my phone today and, since i don't have voicemail, i wasn't sure who it was. normally i would have left it but i'm looking for a job right now so i was worried it might have been one of the places i applied to. i called them back and got an answering machine. the person mentioned some sort of court position so i assumed it was for jury duty and left a message with my phone number but nothing else (not even a name). i then realized two things. firstly, i would receive something in the mail for jury duty and, secondly, i just gave a stranger my cell phone number (which could possibly be used to get more information). i am now having a panic attack.

how screwed am i and is it possible for me to prevent anything bad that might happen as a result of my stupidity?"

"recruiting scam/ phishing or legitimate? earlier this week i’ve received an email with a position offer after the company « found my resume on indeed ». let me know whether you guys think that this is a scam/ phishing or not. if you have any questions, i’d be glad to answer with further details. things don’t seem to be pointing to this being legitimate, but i really want it to be :( all emails were detailed an didn’t contain any grammatical error, save for one tiny typo.

 i responded with interest, but did ask if the actual had a canadian office in my city (since on their website they only have an address in orlando, florida). they responded with another detailed email stating that the position would consist of a remote 2 week training period (paid) and then if i decide that it’s for me i would meet with my fellow team mates. we would then start working in the new office which will apparently be ready in the second half of march. i did see that yesterday they had added an address in my city to their website, although it was in a residential area. they also send a file of the job description including further detail titled job_description.pdf. obviously i was suspicious and did not open it, but copied the link instead. the link would lead to sendgrid.net with a long url and since this site is used for file charging it didn’t really help me much. they’ve sent me another email this morning asking if i am still interested.


also, online the only sign of the company is their website, for which the domain seems to only have been registered since 23-feb-2020. zero presence on linkedin.

any insight is welcome and much appreciated :)

i’m wondering if this is a scam i honestly have no idea and i would like to know from the big brains on the subreddit so my mom and i don’t lose any money. there’s another image that explains why we are getting the check which i will write down what it said in the comments.

"job connections scam? i hope you guys can help me cuz i am honestly really freaking out about this one. i'm trying to stay a bit anonymous here and may delete this post after i get an answer or at the least, some opinions. some small details have been changed as well but i'm willing to clarify if needed. i also apologize if this is not the ride reddit, i'm just in need of others' insights and figured this was an appropriate place. 

so i had ended my workday and drove to my local grocery store to get stuff to make hamburgers for me and my husband. i'm in the bread aisle deciding what kind of bun i want to get when this random person in the aisle starts talking to me, saying how its a good day for burgers. i of course, being the awkward person i am, went ""uh huh, yeah."" the person was asking details of my meal then noticed the sweater i was wearing had my former college on it and we began talking about college life, finding jobs and how hard it was to find connections. 

this person then mentioned maybe exchanging numbers because we were ""having a great conversation"" and that they may have ""some connections"" they can share with me. 

me being partially intrigued, yet mostly just wanting to just buy my buns and go home said yes and we exchanged numbers.

 keep in mind i was already perplexed by this, like i don't mind small talk but in the bread aisle with a person, i literally don't know? t

hey text me later confirming my number, but to me in an oddly ""professional"" sort of manner. like: ""it was great meeting you today! i will talk to some of my connections about you!"" i'm polite, say thank you and that i will let them know if i hear anything for them as well. but i'm still on edge about this. 

come today, the person texting me says that they ""..have great news! i chatted with a person i know about you and they are open in having a conversation with you based on what i told them!"" 

alarm bells are ringing. we talked for all of 10 min, there is no way they know a lot about me. 

i asked a simple question in response, ""okay, what does this person do for a living?""

the answer shocked and scared me enough that the head cold i've been battling dissipated in a matter of seconds. 

""you sound unappreciative and rude... \*some description about a few private family-owned businesses with no insight in what they are or what exactly the person does\* ...why are you asking?""

i'm not joking when i said that i was shocked enough by this really rude reply that my cold was suddenly gone.

 i immediately texted my husband, my sil and called my dad telling them of the situation and how weird and uncomfortable it was making me feel. my husband and sil said it sounded super sketchy and to block, with my sil saying ""say thanks but no thanks"" and my dad said to let it sit for a few days. 

they are currently blocked on my phone, but what the hey is this? is this a genuine person trying to make a connection? it is an mlm or phone scam? i was tired, hungry and just at the beginnings of my cold when they approached me and i was wondering if i was a target for a scam. what are your opinions?

some additional random info: 

* i did look up the person by their phone number given to me on facebook and linkedin and it does seem real with information with matches up to what they told me. 
* they work for a well known legit company in my area.
* after that ""angry"" text the person sent, i replied back saying ""i just wanted to know more information about the person i'm talking to."" they responded back going ""oh okay i gotcha! i was just super intrigued by you when we talked and don't want you to get the wrong impression."" 

tldr: random person approaches me in-store and asks to connect professionally and we exchange numbers. after a few texts back and forth, they get extremely defensive when i ask (in my head) a pretty common question and are now blocked. but what was this?"

"is my chiropractor ripping me off? went in for an appointment monday and all they did was take x rays of my spine, charge $150, and tell me to come back today. so i went today and they tried signing me up for a 12 month $5,800 dollar plan with over 100 adjustment sessions. you can assume what my response was to that, and instead i asked if they can do a pay per adjustment to which they ""cant"" ofcourse, so i settled with four sessions for just this month for a whopping $200 along with some other b.s. support classes once a week that comes with it. i have never heard of anything like this. is this outlandish to anyone else or is it just me?"

okay so now she wants me to buy her a $25 ebay card so she can buy something then she will send me my “allowance.” so tell me, how much bull shit you think this is?"
"cheerfun.net charged me for a service i never paid for so i was just checking my bank account and i noticed i've been charged by something called ""cheerfun.net"" 

i checked what it could be and it looked like one those fishy streaming service (pay 84.95€ per month to get any media you want) 

i looked into their ""support"" section and the first question they seem to be asked is : ""i don’t remember signing up, why am i being charged?"" their answer is that it could be because of someone in our household or else we should contact them directly. 

since i don't understand how i could've been charged, i looked back into my mails, looking for odd ones which could try to scam me but i didn't find anything. i also checked my history, trying to see if i didn't go into any fishy websites or put my credit informations anywhere. 

at the end, i didn't find anything. what i know is that scammers can use my credit card if i (unintentionally) give away my informations. however i don't recall doing that, so i'm really confused as to how i've been charged.

can someone enlighten me ?"

has anyone heard of the new york executive? 

their linked in posting looks pretty official but then they seemed way too eager about an in person interview without even a phone interview. they also sent me an ""information packet"" that's basically a blank website and then a twitter with a bunch of stock photo memes.

hacker exposes scam call center's cctv footage to educate people 
pet sitting scam i was very close to falling for this one but was able to find stuff online before it was too late. it seemed way to good to be real. a lady named naomi is moving to your area with her husband. she is 6 months pregnant and is shipping her dogs busta and jeff up the night before. they ask you cash their check and do some shopping for them before they arrive as well as caring for their husky and german shepherd the night before they get there. they just ask for 2 days a week 2 hours each day and pay 35 per hour for both dogs. sadly this is a scam.
"moving company scam in canada, advice welcomed just wondering what options i have here. last year i was planning on shipping my vehicle across the country and used the website mvs canada. now i was under the impression that this large of an organization would not use scam artists but i got unlucky. i got in contact with a company named able auto based out of ontario. he sent me a quote which was pretty reasonable, i spoke with him on the phone and he wanted a deposit. first of $800 but i bargained to $500. unfortunately it was an etransfer. fast forward to a couple weeks later, plans changed, i couldn’t move forward anymore. the moving date was still months away. i asked for a refund and he assured me i’d receive it. i won’t make this any longer but suffice to say, i was at him for months and my mom called and dad also and called multiple times and he reassured constantly i would get refunded. this is 8 months after the fact. i filed a claim with bbb, and the company replied saying they have nothing to do with this man named “steve” and he has been operating under their name. but that is not true. steve is able auto. their yelp page at one point said they have been operating since the 70s and multiple claims have been filed against them on bbb from others but i didn’t see them for some reason until after the fact. i’m aware i probably have no recourse now, but i would love for them to see some kind of justice."

"personal assistant scam? i applied to a job not too long ago and everything seemed pretty legit. i checkout the website, and found their location in town based off that information. later i got a follow up email telling me to contact one of the hr director for an interview time. i sent it, and got a response saying the position had been filled, but one of their senior's would be moving here soon and needed an assistant. it seemed a little red flaggy here, but i'm a broke college grad with no money, so i figured why not. they haven't asked me for any personal information yet, other than a address and my drivers license number since i'll be driving for the job, and after emailing back and forth it seems to be a little more legitimate, that is until i stop getting email responses for a week. suddenly one random day about a week later i get a text from the guy. it's normal, basic introduction, and then he says he's mailing me a check and needs me to await further instructions. that's where the big flag goes off for me. i'm 90% positive its scam, but of all the ones i've come across since graduating this one seems the most played out and odd. does anyone have any experience with something like this?"

"evergy (electricity utility) spoof call scary good scam call i just got, they're getting sophisticated! recorded message saying i was in danger of having my electricity disconnected for non-payment. it was a good recording, non-accented english and good grammar, gave an 888 number to call back. 

a few problems... the biggest being that i have auto-pay and am not behind on my bill, but besides that...

they called my cell phone, which is not the phone number on the account. 

the 888 number they gave does not match the customer service number for evergy.

the phone number they called from does not trace back to evergy in any way (and no evergy caller id info).

recorded message instilling a sense of urgency! act now! super red flag! 

(i actually had an issue with auto-pay once, and, yes, the utility did call me, but they called a bunch of times and it was a live person and they never once threatened to disconnect my service, they just wanted payment. no idea why, after 10 years of auto-pay there was that hiccup, but i can say that in that exact circumstances, very very very different approach!)

caller # (913) 105-7673

number they gave to call back:  1-888-462-9566

always double-check numbers and remember that unless it's on fire, it's probably going to be okay while you check out some things!"

"almost certain i fell for a scam...but how safe am i? alright so i feel like a real idiot right now... sorry in advance for the length. i feel like context is needed.

for a little bit of context, i'm a lonely mid 20s man and i happened to be drinking tonight and messing around on hinge, a dating app.

i'm not bad looking and i have gone on actual real life dates with attractive women from this app, so i usually know what's in or out of my league. i match with this really pretty girl on there and we start chatting. we start off with some surface level small talk, she says she's always lived in this town, has a job at a law firm, went to school and grew up here in the city, etc. her hinge profile even seems legit, no red flags there really. 

so anyways as i usually do, i ask her what she's doing on here, what she's looking for. she mentions she just got out of a relationship and just wants to have some fun, wants a distraction. i also just got out of a relationship and am looking for something casual, so i mention that and we talk a bit more. she then asks me for my phone number. sure, i give her my number and we carry on conversation via texts. her phone # checks out, area code matches my city, and her grammar is just fine. all seems pretty normal.

after our texting gets a little flirty, she sends me a photo of herself in underwear and wants to see me do the same. i oblige, and she asks to see more. \*sigh\* i oblige... you know where this is going. 

we trade about 5 or 6 photos and videos of ourselves, she tells me how hot i am, tells me to keep sending some, she keeps sending them too... and then, boom. nothing. she disappears, doesn't respond to any of my texts, nothing. immediately my heart drops and i feel like i've just been scammed. in fact i'm almost certain now. i feel like an idiot for not having seen it from the start but like i mentioned i'm pretty vulnerable these days and i really just got caught up in all the attention. 

i take pride in my ability to find people online, so i tried to look up every iteration of her name anywhere i could. nothing. i check her phone # and all sources indicate it most recently belonged to/belongs to a man in his 50s. i spend some time feeling like an empty shell of a human and a total sucker.

here's the thing though: i deactivated my facebook years ago, and all i have is instagram and twitter, which are both on private settings (someone has to send me a request to follow me or see my followers/following). it's been a few hours now and this ""girl"" hasn't sent me any threats, so i'm wondering if i'm safe here? maybe they couldn't get anything on me and let it go? what info can they get about me based solely on some photos and my phone #? do scammers like this usually start sending threats and blackmail right away or do they usually wait a while? i don't have the money to pay off blackmail so honestly if he/she is gonna leak them it's just gonna happen. i'm not entirely too worried about it, although it'd be kind of embarrassing it wouldn't be anything that could get me to lose my job or anything."
"so i got a call from an unknown number regarding a survey today, and i’m panicking a bit. the unknown number called me, it was a girl asking me if i wanted to be part of a survey that could provide valuable information for financial institutions or something like that. i did not provide any information whatsoever, however, when i said “i’m not interested” she asked me “are you sure” and i said “yes”.

now i’m afraid i messed up by saying yes, like one of those yes scams that they talk about on the internet, where they make you say yes and use that as confirmation to make unauthorized purchases under your name. should i be worried? did i mess up? or am i just overthinking it?"
"beware of online job scams dear reddit community,
i have to admit i’m too naive and trustworthy of people online and in the real world. i was looking for a job on indeed.com. stupid me, i was contacted to one of the jobs that i applied. it seemed legit because they had a website and everything. i gave them my checking account like any job. they’ll send me money and put it into bitcoin. this is when hell broke lose. they said they’ll talk to my bank but all are lies to make you seem like they care. instead, you end up being the shit end of the stick owing people money. your bank ends up blaming you and you’re the victim for not knowing and that you should know better. yes i get it. sure make me feel more like shit like when i am already in the dumps. 

beware of pront-messenger! they also have a reddit post account. and a website known as pront-messenger.com. wish i could tear it down."

"worst experience working with beautifully passive llc (my $52,500 are stuck with them)!  extremely unpleasant experience with beautifully passive llc. a very unprofessional, rude and unethical group. horrible communication and worst customer service i ever had.

in total, i bought 4 fat freeze machines from beautifully passive last year and till to date i made no money and above all my whole money is stuck with them.

the sales person robb from beautifully passive literally tricked me into contract signing by making false claim that each spa/salon will pay me a minimum of $4000 per fat freeze machine per month. this later on came out to be a false claim. 

additionally, in contract, beautifully passive llc guaranteed to place machines within 60 days of contract signing but till to date my machines are not even shipped from china as their delivery is delayed till march (super late vs. their guarantee in contract).

and that’s not all guys. when i was sure they don’t have a good justification for all the contract breaches they did, i demanded the refund which beautifully passive initially declined but eventually the company owner steve promised to do so by feb 4th but till to date he did not refund a single penny.

today, unfortunately, i am left with no option but to file a lawsuit against them.

below is full story:

i came to know about beautifully passive llc  in september, 2019 where their salesperson robb made big statements right from day one claiming how secure this investment is and how quickly i will recover my whole investment. according to him even in worst case i will be earning a lot as each spa/salon will pay me a minimum of $4000 per month per fat freeze machine and if the spa earns more, i will get 50% of it. the offer looked very attractive and they further convinced me by showing that this is a part of the contract. i therefore went ahead and initially bought 2 fat freeze machines and a month later bought 2 more fat freeze machines.  

i was very excited as according to how beautifully passive claimed, i was going to earn a minimum of $16000 a month since i bought 4 machines from them. 

after \~1.5 months (in the beginning of december 2019), i started getting little concerned as per 60 day timeline of machine placement, the first two machines were supposed to be placed by december 18th but till the first week of december beautifully passive llc could not even secure a single spa/salon. i could easily see that a delay in placement is imminent but none of them reached me out pro-actively to inform this (thanks to their horrible communication and customer service). anyways, i started interrogating their placement team where after a few discussions i got the biggest shock of my life i.e. the claim made by beautifully passive that spa/salon will be required to pay me a minimum of $4000 per month per fat freeze machine was false and this clause is written very differently in the agreement which i was going to sign with the spa/salon (once beautifully passive llc would secure the spa). in reality there was no such thing that spa/salon will be paying me a minimum of $4000 per month per machine.

i immediately reached out to robb (the sales guy who sold this opportunity to me). i thought he would immediately admit his mistake as he knew the main reason why i invested in this business opportunity was because of secure income promise he did. instead of admitting his mistake, he initially pretended that there’s no significant difference in what’s written in agreement with spa vs. how they had always claimed but seeing i had all the written documentation, he started making statements like i am worrying too much about minor things instead should trust them and wait till machines are placed as i will make much more than that and will eventually thank them.

i was highly disappointed as instead of understanding the severity of the issue he was still making big statements. 

i asked him to immediately involve the company owner steve and after several unsuccessful attempts to have a thorough conversation with steve on this matter i concluded that since they made a false claim about their business model and since they had severely delayed the machines placement vs. how it was promised in contract, it made no sense to continue with them as in no way it was a passive income. in fact, till to date i have spent countless hours running after them due to lack of proper communication from their end. i therefore demanded the refund on jan 11th, 2020.

they altogether declined my request and since then have put my account on hold. as a result my whole money is stuck with them and it’s now the 5th month where i made no money at all and at the top of that i am paying heavy interest on the amount i paid them since the whole amount was taken from a bank loan. 

i wrote about this on reddit on january 21st, after which steve approached me and promised to do the full refund within two weeks and asked me to take the post off reddit. not knowing his intention, i did so but till todate despite several reminders and requests, he did not refund a single penny.

so this is my story. i am left with no option but to file a lawsuit against beautifully passive llc and i am hopeful that eventually justice will prevail. i will keep you guys fully updated on this. anyways, just want to say that even though i am very much embarrassed to make it public that i made such a bad decision and invested such a huge amount in a completely wrong company, i want to make sure that general public take it as a learning from my experience and make sure they do their due diligence and proper research before they invest with companies like beautifully passive llc which have very little to no internet presence on internet."

i am a first seller on letgo. i am selling a phone for about $700.

 people are messaging me about the phone and are offering more than asking price. all i have to do is ship to them. they'll pay me through cashapp or paypal they say. (are those legit ways of getting paid?) i don't understand why they go over asking price, but it is suspicious. should i be weary about selling stuff that valuable, nationwide? 

also, none of their accounts have reviews or anything. it makes me curious/weary about this. 

any advice?

"selling car on kijiji - possible scam? hello guys,

so i am going back and forth on this. i posted my car for sale on kijiji. it’s a 2017 with 21000 km and i am asking 35,000 for it. 

a potential buyer reached out to me and we spoke on the phone. he is from a province on the east cost and i am in toronto. he said he loved the car, asked questions about it’s history and we agreed to 32k. he said he would be sending me a bank draft through his credit union for the amount we agreed on and he would send me a deposit before hand as well.  

initially i thought nothing of it, but then thought who buys a car without seeing it, and why from across the country? he mentioned once he mails the draft and it clears, he will arrange shipping with a trucking company.

i know of the fake check scam, but now protected am i with a bank draft? if i receive it, wait for it to clear and then send the car, am i safe? what if i inform him to send a wire transfer instead? am i fully protected? he seems like an honest guy, found him and his wife on social media, his business, and also have both their phone numbers which seem legit. 

i also still owe money on the car so i would have to pay off the financed amount prior to sending it away. i just don’t want to accept a bank draft or wire transfer only for it to reverse a week later once the car is gone and  i have paid the motor company. what do you think?"

""billing report waiitting update info""
there was a pdf file attached which, for obvious reasons, i did not open. i did contact amazon as i've been a customer forever and had never received such a document. the rep i spoke to hadn't heard of this one either and even though i don't necessarily believe anyone on reddit will fall for this please do pass along to your parents or those who may well download this. fucking asshole scammers."

"buying weed online hey ya'll,

&amp;#x200b;

if you're ever abroad, alone, and want to get any *goodies*, never buy it online.

unfotunatelly i was a scam victm, from a guy named greenie, he goes by the email [local420delivery@yahoo.com](mailto:local420delivery@yahoo.com). (any other email like that should be a scam too, keep that in mind).

i'm alone in a completely new country, looking to score some weed somehow, and i passed across this list of comments saying that this greenie dude was real deal, good hook up, nice weed, amazing strains.

so, desperate to score some weed, i emailed him, he answered me and told me to follow his instructions via whatsapp (through a czech phone number (+420)).

me, being a idiot, i went along, and made the payment via cryptocurrency.

as i waited for greenie's boss to confirm the payment was made, and send the package, the ""boss"" contacted me via whatsapp as well, stating that delivery man was caught and they needed extra money to buy new hermetic sealed cases to transport my package (it was an american number this time).

it took me a while to realise i was being scammed, and unfortunatelly i was an idiot enough to make a upfront payment.

fortunatelly it was just 100€, which i can make up in a couple of days working, but it is still a scam and i don't want them taking money from people who just really want to smoke a few joints, and can't afford loosing money, so i'm doing my part sharing here (honestly, i don't want nobody getting scammed for anything).

i googled a lot and didn't find anyone alerting for this email, thats why i got induced into believing it was a real thing.

they seem to do this kind of scam in all over the globe.

so please, don't be as idiot as me, never try buying drugs online, do the old fashioned way, look for young people smoking, ask them if they could help you score some.

and whatever you do stay away from greenie and his email [local420delivery@yahoo.com](mailto:local420delivery@yahoo.com) .

&amp;#x200b;

i learned a valuable lesson, no need to teach again.

bizarre spam email with unnerving faded texted between regular spammy paragraphs. received a couple of these. anybody experienced this? 
"strange grocery store lady i hope i provide enough information here for people to speculate, but there really isn't much to this story. i'm just hoping that someone here will recognize something that i didn't because i can't stop thinking about this strange lady i saw at the grocery store today and i don't know much about scams. 

basically, i was waiting in line at checkout and this woman stepped behind me with a bag of lettuce. i had a bunch of stuff, so i ask if she wanted to go in front of me. she quickly said ""oh no that's fine"" but i insisted and pointed out she was only getting one thing. she then said that she also needed to go get some milk so she put the lettuce on the counter and then went to go get a carton of milk. the person in front of me was still being checked out so when the lady returned i pulled my cart out out of the checkout aisle and allowed her to go in front of me. 

once the clerk started talking to her and asked for her kroger card she said, ""oh no i forgot my card"". the clerk said it was fine and that he could just scan his personal card but then the strange lady said she was talking about her credit card. she said she would be right back and quickly walked outside to go get her card. i am pretty sure she just left after that. i didn't see her outside the store and never saw her walk back in as i waited for a minute inside my car. 

i'm not sure why this intrigued me so much, but something about the woman leaving very quickly after i let her go ahead made me think something was up. also, some extra info about the lady is that she looked like she had either just gotten out of bed or was homeless, i'm really not sure which one either. 

so what do you all think the strange lady was up to? i know this sub is about scams, but i'm open to a broad range of possibilities. even simple ones like the idea that she is homeless and was simply just going to beg for the food. either way, i'm interested in what hearing other people think."

dont fall for this scam! let me know if someone of you got the same, would be interesting to see :)

&amp;#x200b;

the e-mail:

 hello,  


this email contains very important information about your future life! please read this carefully.  


this is kevin poulsson. also known as kevpson on the dark web.  
i spent my entire life working on digital security app developments, besides i am really a very good hacker/data leecher - if not the best.  


i think around eight months ago, i hacked this email address. you can check it. i am sending this email from your own email address now. (~~xxxx@xxxxxxxx.de~~)  


i injected my code to all the devices which you had opened your mailbox on. and i started to monitor the activity on your devices. my first idea was to block and encrypt your files. than i would ask for a small fee to release them back. but than one day, you visited some dirty websites. you know what i mean naughty thing. and i silently activated your front camera and recorded you. yes! you were playing with yourself. what a funny video.  


now, i stole contact list of yourself. i have all your friends lists. a lot of information was downloaded to my system. checking your system with the antivirus systems will of course not work. i told you, i am not a rookie!  


what do i want? well i am asking from you a small fee of 690 usd. this is the cost of my time, and i had spent quite a lot of time on you.  
if you don't pay my fee, all the naughty screen videos will be delivered to your friends and family.  
no i am not kidding, this is business.  
but if you cooperate with me, i promise that i will delete these files as soon as i receive the payment. i will not need them anymore.  


send the amount to my bitcoin address:  
13hbjgfshbmncypuym9s8aio2nvwkcazjx  


i will give you 30 hours to complete the transfer. when you open that message, i will know it and the countdown starts.  
if you had never purchased bitcoins before, i suggest you to act quickly. the first time orders may take some time and you have limited time!  


be smart, do not ignore me! do not trust the devices and security programs, they never really protect you. do not click on every link you see. always use stronger passwords on the internet. and the golden rule: never trust anybody!  


good luck  
your time has already started.."
"ran into a gym scam, possibly? anyone know more about this? so i got a call from a ""gym"" telling me that i owed them $200 in back payments. he told me he was with gym a, but i never went to gym a i went to gym b. 

he told me that he didn't want the bill to go to collections, and that if i entered into a new contract for a $70 down payment the old bill would be forgiven. this sounds like a total scam. i'm 90% sure i didn't sign up with ""his"" gym, but now he has me second guessing myself. 

also what gym will just forgive a debt for more money? that sounds like bogus. he specifically mentioned that he ""didn't want it to hurt my credit score"" but why would some random employee care? i'm sure that real employees deal with tons of these cases, why bother calling me? just looking for input, sorry if this is the wrong place."

obviously red flags to me and i haven’t answered or called back any of the three numbers. i looked around a bit but didn’t see anything on this specific tactic but i’m 99% sure it’s a scam. someone wants my social security number. anyone else heard of this tactic? should i give the real social security administration a call and ask if anything’s up just in case?"

the letter said a car registered to him (correct number plate given) was parked in an area monitored by them (no details given) on the 13/12/2019 and he had an incurred a $92.00 fine and immediate payment was required or lawyers would be involved. the letter goes to great lengths to say how he should pay now and forego any additional legal costs. their payment details take up the bottom half of the letter.

definitely a scam as the car in question is an old car of my dad's. it is unregistered but he still has the number plates as they are old custom ones. he is pulling the car apart and restoring it and it has not left his enclosed garage for 22 years! 

the best part is that he was driving his daily car the day of the supposed parking violation, he crossed several toll bridges in another state over 400km away. 

just a money grab exercise."
"job offer scam? i think so! i received this job offer a few weeks ago, and today someone called me claiming to be a recruiter and emailed this back to me. i am seeing red flags all over their personal document that the sent (the also sent a uscis form i-9 and w-4 forms). the first attachment is the email that they have sent. the others are their in-house pdf. 

either way, i'm not applying. who gives out their ssn to a company that they've never heard of? i never give out my ssn over email either, even if i know them personally. i make them call. 

one last thing before the pictures, i have no clue what company this position is for. 

these are filled with spacing issues, spelling, and wanting some personal information on day one.

"super embarrassed but i fell victim just a few moments ago. what can they do with this info and how do i protect myself? so i graduated college 4 years ago but my .edu email is still active. i’m embarrassed i fell for this one but it seemed legit, here’s what happened: 

received an email from another person with a @[college].edu address. 

it said that they’re looking for alumni to put a big ass decal on their car for some extra cash weekly. i know the college is struggling with enrollment rates so it seemed like some stupid move they’d pull. 

it was “signed” by a legitimate person who works at the college. i looked the name up on the college’s website to be “safe”. it was 100% accurate. 

it said to reply with full name, address, email, phone number, make/model of car if you’re interested. i’m always down for extra cash so i did it. 

i texted a college friend to ask if they got it and they sent me back a screenshot from the it dept. that said it was a scam and to not reply. i still haven’t gotten that email. but i already replied. 

super embarrassed because i’m normally pretty aware and have never fallen for anything before. 

what can they do with that information and how can i make sure they don’t do it to me now?"

* phone scams, one of the most prevalent types, have cost victims more than $72 million since october 2013, according to the treasury inspector general for tax administration.

they are asking to send me a cheque, and asked for my  cheque details. (name / address / etc). they haven’t asked for anything that would actually allow them into my bank (i have a good $5 in there anyways). 

i don’t know if this is scam (probably is) or if i have just became the luckiest 18 year old on this planet. 

please someone help me out with this cause i don’t know what to do. it definitely seems too good to be true, so is it ?

"which is the scam? just had a call from my father. he was in amsterdam yesterday for a meeting, bit odd as i thought he was on holiday in scotland but nevermind.

i was obviously curious.

turns out he had got contact from someone about an overseas holiday home that he has on the market to sell but also available as a rental (tough to sell houses in greece at the moment) 

the caller said they were interested in buying it. said they were an investment business and were in amsterdam, could they meet, so he went. fine.

 

turns out it’s a billion percent not legal, but forgive me for sketchiness on the details, this was a call at lunch today:

let's assume it's 100k euros.

it involves them giving him €20,000 in cash as the first part of the payment.

him giving them a separate €20,000 in low denomination cash. they give him that €40,000 back in high denomination bills (500 euro notes). plus they give him 10% on the first 20k as a thank you.

then they give him the rest (60%) in semi-legitimate ways.

&amp;#x200b;

i laughed and cried a little inside that these cunts exist. he saw straight through it and told the guy it didn’t make sense. 

it’s just money laundering was his conclusion – mine was that it’s not (just) money laundering, it’s a scam to get 20,000 out of him. they’ll disappear then and it’s not about moving money, it’s about just quick cash from people.

might be both?

either way, he saw through it but wasted a couple of days going to amsterdam. i know he’s keen to sell the house but crikey.

"onerpm is scam!they steal musicians money and keep it! i like advise all artists/musicians do not use onerpm not only they scam but commit fraud,just google them and you see(they even got lawsuit from ex employees saying they ripping off artist)onerpm currently owes me over $1,500 in royalities(it still counting up to this day).

 

onerpm  
it is a company that is stealing money from artists and using predatory pre-text to keep artist money and closing their accounts then ignoring their emails.

they seem to be keeping artists earnings by  
banning their account and making up lies  
based on their predatory terms.

and after researching onerpm i found out  
alot of musicians also scammed by this  
company and onerpm even has a lawsuit in  
tenneessee due they way they handle their  
business.it is public records and you see how artists are being scammed.

onerpm also didnt even respond to  
bbb even after i complained

1/04/2020 – onerpm decided to randomly  
close my account however i have funds  
owed to me that i cannot access and i would  
like to receive all my money/funds owed.  
one rpm decided to randomly close my  
account they claim due to “editorial  
standards”,but they would not even explain  
what standards. i cannot access my account  
to withdraw my funds

1/06/2020 – filed complaint to bbb

1/13/2020 – onerpm agreed to give me all  
my funds,they provided some of my funds.

1/22/2020 – onerpm refusing to give my  
money claiming on lies such as  
“infraction”.you can request an explanation,  
or some actual detail about the purported  
infractions, but all they’ll do is send you a  
copy of their user agreement – and then stop  
responding to emails.

here are others scammed by onerpm

onerpm also tried to keep my whole catalog available for sale online and for streaming after they blocked my ability to collect on future funds. they were basically planning on collecting 100% of my royalties from the sales and streaming of my whole catalog, had i not contacted bbb onerpm was not only going to keep my money but were going to keep my other releases online.

onerpm repeatedly steals funds from artist / label accounts, by inventing pretexts that allow them to absorb whole royalty payouts. they then proceed with little to no communication from support staff in the hopes of silencing requests / demands from the artists they rip off. this a fraud company(i posted sites/complaints of onerpm stealing from artists).

onerpm closed my account based on “editorial reasons”according to onerpm. yet they claim “infringement” when not only is the email i received from them about infringement false i had requested onerpm to remove all my music from stores way before they claim to close my account based on my “infringement”(which i asked proof they never provided all they did was sending same auto response email to read their predatory terms). i have provided screenshots showing onerpm is making false statements. i requested an explanation, or some actual detail about the purported infractions, but all they’ll do is send you a copy of their user agreement – and then stop responding to emails.

on top of that onerpm still had my music illegally still in stores even when i requested to remove all my music and told onerpm they no longer had legal rights to distribute my music all this is in my bbb complaint file.

the fact onerpm had my music online illegally when i told them to remove it(i have screenshots) and then my other releases which earned royalty onerpm is keeping shows this a fraud company.

&amp;#x200b;

i complained to youtube,spotify,apple,etc nothing has been done about it matter of fact youtube said if a mcn violates their terms they loose privileges clearly onerpm violated terms and i have evidence.

this company is still holding my money,and get this two of my albums are still on google play(can provide screenshots) and im trying to contact google play to remove it.

the company onerpm is scammed and are basically ripping off indie artists!"

"got scammed with vlone jeans from depop, help ok so i recently purchased vlone jeans that i really wanted. paid the seller, and he sent me normal jeans that aren’t vlone. i all i have is his real name and his address. i already contacted depop, they said they can’t help me with it since i can’t prove if i actually got the non-vlone jeans. 
already tried paypal claim. i was confident that i was gonna win it but idk what the f**k he did, i lost that case too.

at this point i know i can’t get my money back, i just want to make him lose more money than i did. any suggestions to f**k him up really bad? he lives in canada."
"instagram dm scam but from someone you know hey idk if this is the right place to ask about this, but i’m a little nervous after getting phished on insta.

i often get phishing attempts on the app, but they’re always so painfully obvious that it was funny. also it was always from strangers.

anyway this totally ratchet chick i used to know from high school dmed me in the morning, so i woke up and immediately checking my phone, still a little groggy.

there were two messages that went something like this:
‘hey i worked on this for two hours i hope you like it!’
‘*link saying* ‘i hope you love it!’ ‘

being a little out of it from just waking up i didn’t think twice clicking it. we were in a high school group together and i assumed she was spiraling and made some stupid nostalgic slideshow from a time several years past and sent it to a bunch of ppl. also knowing her it was highly likely there were some nudes in there lol. she’s ratchet as fuck.

anyway when i clicked it it pulled up an instagram login which i obviously fucked up and absentmindedly filled in. nothing happened and i was just confused. i just replied to her ‘what’s this’ ‘??’ and went about my day. i figured whatever she sent me was made over some really shitty third party app that wasn’t working right or something, idfk. after that i thought nothing of it.

later today i get tons of messages on instagram from friends saying i’ve def been hacked and ya so now i feel retarded. i changed my password a couple times and turned on two factor login, then i either changed other passwords or added layers of protection like biometrics. what else should i do? i haven’t found any other evidence of shit gone awry on my other important accounts, and fwiw i haven’t gotten any more reports from friends of getting messages after i locked down the account (besides one odd occurrence where a friend got a message, he told me, we talked, then later he says it sent again, but the time stamp for the second message was still hours ago, and still before i locked everything down. however, the conversation i just had with that friend was deleted when he told me he got that second message, the notifications on that chat had also been muted again.

should i still be worried?"
"i’m 16 and being blackmailed it’s complicated, but i met a guy on kik, messaged him and sent him some illicit pics of me. idk how but he got the numbers of several family members, and i know he has them because he sent me them. i want to cut things off but when i told him he said he’ll send the pictures to my parents and siblings. and i believe him. he would definitely do that. what should i do? i saw that you should contact the fbi but my parents can’t know. what should i do? this is super urgent"

"tradehouse investment group. is it a scam? someone i know recently started posting about forex trading and we got on facetime and he was explaining to me what forex was and stuff. he mentioned something about how there's a $230 fee and then i can use the harmonic scanner and something that would tell me when to buy and sell and educational videos and such and mentors to teach me how to trade. i told him that i didn't have the money for that but he said that he would cover that for me, all i would need is $10 to start. how do i know i am not being scammed? i know that when i am going to deal with a broker i have to ask for certification, but is there anything else i can ask to make sure i am not getting scammed?"
"paypal text... i got a text from paypal ""paypal: thanks for checking out with paypal. reply ""y"" to confirm we have the right mobile number for you. msg &amp; data rates may apply."" i think it's a scam because i don't have an account but i feel like there should have been some fishy link for me to click and there wasn't...?"
"need some help in identifying if this is a scam hi all, first time posting in this sub, needing some help regarding an item i’m selling on gumtree, it’s a gaming laptop. i don’t use sites like ebay or other similar sites that often, so i’m quite amateur when it comes to identifying things like this.

i’ve already received one message on ebay which i soon realised was a scam as they were offering $100 above the asking price plus they only joined ebay today and had no feedback.

i then received an email and i will discuss the details now. they asked about condition of the item which is fair, but they then said they will add $250 on top of the asking price just so that i can take down the post, they’re reasoning for wanting to pay more is that they have been trying to find this item for a good price for a while now but most of them “have one huge fault, some have had accidents in the past, whilst some are extremely exorbitant”.

they said they are glad to make the payment asap via paypal as it is fast and safe and are onboard and willing to not let me down. they the said they will also pay another $100 for australian delivery charges, which is pretty crazy in my opinion. the asking price is $950, so they’re willing to pay another $350 in total on top of this.

finally they said to get back to them with my payment details so they can pay right away and that i should inform other buyers that it has been sold.

from what i’ve heard when most things sound too good to be true, it most likely is, and this is definitely one of those situations.

i’d like some help in identifying if this is a scam or not. i might add that i originally received an sms from her partner saying that she is interested in buying and to email her the asking price. i checked the sms for a number and there is no contact details, i don’t know how this works?

the email address from the buyer seems somewhat legit as well as the name.

i would love some help with this, thanks."
"interesting car sale scam scammer writes a bad check to private seller of a car. the private seller hands over title (without signing it over) and keys to car. check doesn’t cash but scammer is long gone with car. 

scammer then creates fake idea with private sellers information on it to pass off as the original owner of the car. it matches the unsigned title, and the scammer proceeds to sell the car to the next person, as it looks like they are the owner of the car.

anyone else hear of these kind of car sale scams?"

"is qwantify a scam? they guarantee 10000 in revenue a month by building a drop shipping website for a set fee. i really feel like this should be a scam but their website is quite professional and they get good reviews on trustpilot. the reviews sound fake and its really the only website i can find any reviews on about them. there are a couple reviews i can’t read which is fairly sketchy. there is a contract tho, which would protect me from getting scammed? one part in the contract says that they are not responsible if my site they build me gets stolen. i talked to some tech friends about that and it’s essentially impossible to steal a website so it makes me wonder why thats in the contract to begin with. idk i can’t find anything too much about them"
"help with instagram scam alright so basically i was communicating with a guy on instagram, who was selling his page (or so he said). long story short, i sent him half the money over paypal friends and family, after we had agreed that he would send the log in info after half. well, you can all guess what happened next, he ghosted me. it wasn’t much money thankfully, but it’s the principle of the matter. i’m pissed. he stole money from me. 

to confirm my suspicions, i sent him a dm from another account i have, asking if he’s still selling the page. he said yes. obviously hasn’t responded to my messages from my first account. 

i have his email and first and last name, and it’s super unique and i’m pretty positive i’ve found him on a couple other sites, one on which he brands himself as an “instagram marketing specialist” or something like that. what are my options here?"
"so i saved someone from a scam (story time) i am a college student who went to the grocery store a couple days ago to just get some milk eggs and sausages for breakfast. after i found my items i walked towards the check out line and an elderly lady (probably around 80ish) comes to me and asks if i knew where the gift cards were. for some reason i was thinking about birthday cards and sent her to the birthday card isle. i noticed my mistake and walked her to the gift cards section. she thanked me and i went back in line to pay and leave. after i paid the same lady came to me and asked for some help. i went along with her and she was not sure on what gift card to get. i thought it was going to be for a grandchild so i suggested an apple gift card or a best buy card. i then noticed she had been on the phone for the whole time since i first encountered her and asked who the card was for to which she replied “i don’t it’s for this angry man on the phone” i asked to talk to the person to figure out what the person wanted. she gave me the phone and right from the start i heard an indian voice who was said “why are you fucking giving him the phone” i then realized it must be a scam, so i went along with it asking him what card he needed and he went on to say it was the irs needing money due to tax stuff and i said i was going to give him the number and just fooled with him for a couple minutes before i told him not to call the number again and ended the call and told her it was a scam to she was surprised and couldn’t believe she was falling for it.

i was surprised people still try this scam and that a lot of people still haven’t heard about it. makes me sick to think how much money she might have lost."
"dollar mom club gift card scams this site (which really doesn't have bad reviews or a history of scamming that i could find from a quick google search) was offering bogo gift cards a couple times in late jan early feb. because i thought it's a great deal and didn't see much reason to hesitate, especially having cc protection and them having 120 day 100% money back guarantee on them, i bought quite a few. 

the first that i tried to use, they told me that there is no pin, which is very weird, because their system requires it in order to process a gift card and they don't know where i got these from. i reported this to dollar mom club, and they promptly told me they would refund my order fully. that was weeks ago and i have not received any refund (i'm just not noticing this after other cards are showing as 0 balance).

because of that issue, before sending some gift cards for fridays to my mother as a treat for dinner tonight, i double checked the balance on the cards. i bought 4 $25 cards. 2 had the full 25, 1 had zero and one has $7.28 on it. i then went through and checked the other cards, to find that many of them had $0 or partial balances.

i have a feeling this site is offering ridiculous gift card deals (bogo) because they're doing something extremely fraudulent. if i had to guess, they have a script that is checking balances of thousands and thousands of possible gift card numbers and selling whatever balances it happens to find. this would mean they are stealing gift card credit from people and selling it to others at half price to use on them. this is straight up fraud.

please, share your thoughts. this does not look good at all. i demanded an explanation, but have not heard back from them. i will be filing a charge back with my credit card,  but this needs to be looked into deeper. i cannot find a phone  number for this company. if any internet detectives are able to find one, please share."

viralhog at it again (copyright scam) so viralhog is back with their abusing the copyright system on instagram. they go on meme accounts to find the creator of a video then message the tagged creator to buy the “license” to the video(s). once that is done they fill a copyright report and ask the meme account they originally found the content on to pay them $ to retract the report so they don’t get deleted on instagram. even when the meme account provides evidence of having permission they still want money. to content creators and people who will eventually have viral videos do not deal with viralhog. you’re better off posting your video to youtube yourself. they’re copyright scam/trolling has been going on for years. beware

"sanity check. was this person i was dating trying to scam me? i need opinions. so this woman i was dating needed to pay her rent. she works as a freelance artist. she sold some art that covered her rent. the money was deposited in her account (she screenshoted the balance to show me proof) but for some reason she didn't have access to it yet, i'm guessing because the check needed to clear. she wanted to quickpay me (zelle) the money so i could then cash app it right back to her so that she would have had the funds available so she can pay her rent before it was overdue.

this sounded extremely fishy to me so i did some google and found this: [https://abcnews.go.com/business/beware-scammers-mobile-payment-loophole/story?id=33214634](https://abcnews.go.com/business/beware-scammers-mobile-payment-loophole/story?id=33214634)

after reading that i immediately blocked her. apparently with zelle you can send someone money, then withdraw it from your account before it clears. so when i would have cash app'd her the funds, she could have withdrew the money that she sent me and i would have been shit out of luck.

as a sanity check do you guys think she was actually attempting to do this? i kind of feel bad about cutting her off due to the possibility of me just being paranoid and her actually just needing some help due to her check not clearing. what do you think?"

my question is- some of the people he (or his wife) approached who didn't fall for the scam and told them to piss the fuck off- said the guy wanted them to ""hold"" the jewelry for a few minutes and pretty much shoved it in their hands to hold.

what is the purpose of making the person your trying to scam hold the ""real"" but ""fake"" jewelry?"

"turbotax - customer service scam like a lot of other folks i've gotten started with my taxes, i do them online with turbotax. there are a couple of complications with my return this year and i decided to drop their support a note.

&amp;#x200b;

i got a call today from a gentleman from turbotax, he asked me about my issue. since i was also on slack at the same time, i described my issue only vaguely. the agent then tells me that he's a manager and will help me out but doesn't ask me for any clarifying questions. he tells me that he needs to close out the current case and will open a new one and help me out. then over the next couple of minutes when i wait for the survey link to come over in my email he tells me multiple times that the rating is from 1 to 10 with 10 being the best service. at this point i'm sensing something weird but choose to play along. i got the survey, and filled it up gave him a 6 and in the subsequent questions noted that i wasn't sure if my issue had been resolved. i completed the survey and told him that i was done, he then asked me what i'd rated him, i told him 10 ofcourse, he was pleased and said that he was going to help me now. then he said that he was fixing the issue for me, normally they charge people for this service but he'd do me a favor, i thanked him for being so helpful. he tells me that he's fixed my ny state return, i told him that ny was fine my issue was with the nj, he mumbled and said oh yeah that's what he meant. told me to check back after an hour and that i could then proceed with filing my taxes then and he'd fixed my issue. he wished me a good remainder of my day and i ended the call. i checked my account immediately just to make sure that he'd not messed with anything and nothing had been changed.

&amp;#x200b;

now this isn't the most egregious of scams, no money was asked for nor were any financial details. the scam is basically for him to get you to close the survey and rate him highly, your actual issue isn't addressed. i presume that he did this for commission or he's rated by his surveys.

&amp;#x200b;

tldr version - if a customer service rep asks you to fill out their survey before addressing your concern, don't do it or if you do give them a poor rating."
"i’m a dumbass i just accidentally fell for the, “i have a gift for you” thing on instagram. anyway i can unsend sent dm’s?"
"help! i accidentally gave old health insurance information to a scam company and need to protect myself now i don't know how i let this happen to me, usually i can sniff out a scam right away, but these people called me saying they were working with my insurance company to send prescriptions. i gave them the numbers on my card and birthdate as i was trying to figure out what they were asking me. i told them i don't give them permission to use my account but it seems like they'll just do it anyway. 

i thought it would be harmless because it's not an active insurance plan anymore, and then immediately realized that they would be trying to bill my old insurance and thus the charges would bounce to me.

i've been calling my old insurance company to try and block whatever i can but it doesn't seem to work like a credit report where it'll block fraudulent activity. in fact, my account blocking them seems to be how it works so that ***i*** get billed instead of my terminated insurance account.

i fully realize this was my mistake and now i just need to fix it or put protections in place to ensure they can't execute their scam."
"linda ngo-chan, stephen nickerson to whom this may concern,
 
in early 2018, stephen nickerson started promoting an opportunity to earn a passive income without having to do any work. steve nickerson, who is the founder and ceo of rapidmind solutions inc., conducted webinars, which were promoted through other individuals close to him. on the webinars he was explaining how his system, called automagic, would give financial freedom by combining network marketing, internet marketing, affiliate marketing, and done-for-you sells. he sold 4 marketing packages:
silver (price tag: ~$4,000usd), $5228.63 cad
gold (price tag: ~$8,000 usd), $10,457.27 cad
platinum (~$16,000usd), and $20,914.54 cad
diamond (~$20,000), $26,143.18 cad
diamond was the highest level. together with these packages, a customer would need to make a commitment to purchase 150 pv (app. 190usd) of doterra products per month for a period of one year.

the total investment for the member (i.e. enrollee in the system) would consist of:
1- an initial program fee (as listed above depending on the package).
2- purchase a every oil kit or diamond kit from doterra, worth $1950usd.
3- twelve (12) months products from doterra (worth around 190usd/month including the shipping totaling around 2,250usd).

stephen nickerson assured the investors that the program included an “one-year money-back guarantee,” meaning that if the program failed to fulfill the investors, he would refund the investment amount. he held many webinars over the course of the one year insisting that the program had already worked. he enrolled members who would promote the program aggressively (e.g. linda chan and eric chan, shawn branson and a few others). some of these names are listed at the bottom of this letter, indicating their position in the company as well.
 
stephen nickerson, together with his team kept promoting and stating that all an enrollee would need to do was to choose one of the four done-for-you marketing packages, called automagic, and ensure a monthly order of doterra products worth at least 150pv (personal volume) for a period of at least 12 months.  this would result in the program giving the enrollees (i.e. investors) financial freedom.
 
they would present doterra's compensation program, and describe how automagic would help build an enrollee’s system without having to ever sell doterra products to earn a commission.  they also insisted, the system would work within 6 months.
 
after joining the program, stephen set up a private facebook messenger group titled “automagic q&amp;a” for all investors to share information on.  many promoted the program and reiterated the benefits. as an example, linda chan was extremely active in the group, sharing information and answering queries almost on a daily basis. however, communication on the facebook chat group stopped on november 16, 2018.  no webinar or communication was sent to members.  communication started again on december 4, 2018.  a new member of the automagic team was introduced, nate lindquist.  he was introduced as the “advisor to the ceo.”  there were several investors who wrote in the chat group that they were concerned that no one was added to their downline, as promised by the program, which was the promise made.
 
after members questioning the process, the messages started having a different tone and (nasty).  on december 22, 2018, stephen nickerson shut down the group chat and all communication effectively stopped for several weeks. finally on january 1st, 2019, the members received an automagic email. refer to the email for reference.
 
since then many investors started asking for a refund and contacted the company members (through various channels).  each time the members were asked to show patience, and that stephen nickerson and his team were working tirelessly to meet the agreement.  
 
 
by mid-2019, many investors had reached their 12 months period with automagic, and started asking for a refund.  stephen communicated that he was sorry automagic had not worked as promised. he also shared with us that doterra had forced them to shutdown automagic for 6 months. stephen had not communicated this earlier and apologized for failing to inform that of the program, and for violating doterra's company compliance.  the company started limiting the communications and started residing on email communications at this point.
 
when the company failed in delivering the guarantee, the team created a second program called 4friends through a new company called freedom hack collective. stephen nickerson has promised the automagic members a refund when new members would join. they openly stated that automagic had run out of money and would pay the old members with the money they would take in from new members. this is the very definition of a pyramid scheme. they basically were going to take money from others to pay others.
 
this group of individuals are liable for this pyramid scheme, in which they promised to refund the investment an enrollee would make.
 
in the attached excel sheet, documents related to the pyramid scheme can be found.
 
based on an estimation (attached excel sheet), the members made a total investment of $2,976,000 usd in the program. this is based on a total of 260 members stated by stephen nickerson in a webinar.
 
in this program, the following people were working directly or promoting it:
stephen nickerson (founder)
mandie nickerson (stephen’s wife and doterra wellness advocate)
nate lindquist (online marketing consultant)
shawn branson (coo)
kenneth aaron ignatius (customer service director)
galina lipina (affiliate manager)
scott smythe
joe moulton (ceo - former ceo)
linda ngo-chan (affiliates)
eric chan (affiliates)
we are bringing your attention to this pyramid scheme and we hope you look into it and help the customers to get a refund of our money and set a stop to this scam that continues luring new victims.
 
warm regards,
victims of the scam program"
"ig scam! i made a gift for you, i hope you like it. today, my friends sent me a message that said she made something for me. i was out of it( just woke up) and decided to click it(so stupid of me.)

i immediately noticed it to be a scam since it redirected me to a page to ig login. now i didn’t follow through, however my friend had told me she didn’t sign in as well. she recommended me to change my password in which i did. 

but i have a theory!!!! 

i would recommend to change the password on a computer. just in case that it is a screen watching virus that watches you type your new password (idk if it’s a thing.) maybe i’m being paranoid, but i have a lot of influential people that follows me and would def not want to me on their blacklist with this virus i have no control of.


lmk what y’all did. did y’all just click it and left? did y’all login? 

from others, i learned that this virus takes place a day later or even a week later to send a dm to all your followers."
"scam alert - beware: &lt; seanpaxson &gt; is a scammer. he is also active on wickr  **seanpaxson** is a scammer who spams forums all day long. he pretends to be selling all kinds of stuff, but is not even a merchant.

also he is active on **wickr**, beware of him!

&amp;#x200b;

* in online forums he would register multiple fake accounts to write himself good reviews. many of his fake reviews are just copy pasted. something that should be recognized as a warning already, but not everyone scrolls through forums, most users see an ad and become intrigued...
* the problem is: he wants to be paid in bitcoins upfront. bitcoin transactions, unfortunately cannot be undone, it's not like with your credit card which usually would even come with insurance.

&amp;#x200b;

**how his spam works:**

* he will try to make you send more and more money, making up nonsense reasons for that.
* in case you at some point refuse to send any more money, he will start ghosting you.

"b2b scammer are using my company details - how to stop them? scammers are using our company names and details and have set up a fake website somewhat similar to our name.

they are selling all sorts of commen b2b goods like aluminium scrap, pet bottle waste and lately facemasks to benefit from the corona thing.

they send fake contracts and ask ppl to make a 10-15% prepayment to their luxemburg account. luckily most contact the danish authorities and end up contacting me before they pay - but some have lost 7.000 euros...

danish police say they cannot do anything as these are foreign scammers scamming foreign companies - but i want to stop them.

i have the following contact points:

- a danish telephone number (anonymous)
- 2 hotmail accounts
- linkedin account
- website and domain

i am considering if i can stop their business by getting their emails hacked and domains taken down. but i do not know if this is possible in anyway - and i do not have the ressources to start a trademark domain case.

any ideas? any experiences? advice?"

"huge red flag: i'm being asked to take extra on a payment and yeah i'm like 99% sure it's a scam. basically, this dude contacted my friend who was on indeed listing website design commissions. she passed the job on to me, and i gave him my prices: us$1,000 up-front for the hosting of the website, and my initial work. then after completion, he gives me the rest. however he's saying that the person who made the ""text and logo content"" has some blah-blah scam shit so i have to handle $14k to pay them. of course that sounds bogus.
but what i'm wondering here is if there's a way to do this safely, where i screw the scammer. (also, he specifically asked if i use quickbooks and is saying he'd tell me how to get it to this other person once it's in my account.)
what i was thinking was maybe i take the payments separately so that they can't be refuted together or something. i was thinking i could make the invoice for some digital good related to the website, so that i could refute and be like ""nah i did what was payed for i get this money"", of course recording proof of all of that.
essentially, i'm wondering if there's a way i can make it so that the worse-case scenario is me *not* losing money, and best-case is me getting it all. as of right now i won't go through with it though ofc.

he's also kinda demanding my phone number lol yeah dude not shifty at all."
"stex-messenger: scam or legit? i just recently got an email from someone in stex messenger looking to recruit for part time roles. they provided a website www.stex-messenger.com which is obviously up and running, and mentioned that they have an iphone and google play app for the messenger as well. they mentioned that they want to make the messenger grow to the levels of whatsapp, and have registered a new company in us in new york. they also mentioned that they have offices in uk and hong kong.

how do i know whether this is a scam or legit? if they do hire me for the part time role, and the company does turn out to be a scam, how will that affect me? what do i need to do to ensure that i am safe no matter what this company turns out to be? if i go ahead and accept their employment offer, is it possible that i may be legally liable to something the company may do? other than paying tax in the us, is there anything else that i will be liable for? can i ask them for their company taxpayer id and find out if it's legit or not?"

* in online forums he would register multiple fake accounts to write himself good reviews although he never ever shipped a single order.
* many of his fake reviews are just copy pasted. something that should be recognized as a warning already, but not everyone scrolls through forums, most users see an ad and become intrigued...

**how his spam works:**

* he will try to make you send more and more money, making up nonsense reasons for that.
* in case to refuse t send any more money, he will stop communicating anymore.
* you will never receive your order

"posted byu/rayboy1995 1 year ago i think i may have discovered a ""ring"" of travel/vacation giveaway scams, is there something that can be done? the original post over a year ago has been archived but the my title is of the user/original title who created the post. i wanted to follow-up again as i am about to embark on the trip tomorrow actually. i confirmed with the taino beach resort in the grand bahamas that my reservation is valid, so we are all set there. i also confirmed my spot on the grand celebration cruise ship is valid. all in all i think i should be all set.   


something they did do however which actually makes me not want to do this again. they make you pay resort daily fees. this is typical of any resort and usually built into the room/stay pricing, but it covers the amenities and food at the resort while you are there. i wanted the 5 day 4 night ( 2 night 2 days on cruise ship between florida and the island), however they booked me for the 7 night 6 day (2 nights and 2 days on cruise). i had paid the fees for the shorter of the stays and a day later they came back and said i still owed for fees as i was booked for the longer stay. they booked me incorrectly, and i unfortunately did not physically count the dates they booked me for but instead just made sure i had the proper days off of work. since i sent a text response ""verifying"" that the dates were ok, they were then able to lock me into the longer stay and charge me more. otherwise they would have to make a change to the dates and make me pay a date change fee. i had already booked my flights around the longer stay, so instead of trying to change dates and pay more money or lose money staying in a hotel i paid the extra couple of days of fees for myself and my wife ($30 per person per day so $120 total more). 

all in all it was a little underhanded how they ""accidentally"" booked me for the longer trip and demanded payment after the fact, but since i have all of my dates and reservations confirmed i am feeling more at ease with the entire thing. i think a 7 night and 6 day vaca for 2 people would typically cost after doing some estimations around 2500-3k. i believe after flights and all other expenses paid its been maybe $1500. i'll follow up and post after we get to and from the island and have our little vacation so everyone can see if it was a ""scam"" or not. i think people run scared because so far the only thing that has been ""free"" has been the actually hotel stay or room charge. i don't believe this is a scam, but i do think they are slightly shady and i completely understand why people shy away from these kinds of ""winnings"". update to follow! if anyone else has been on this trip let me know!"
hey do y'all know if you can find someones ip address if they are talking to you in the phone i got threatened in kik saying that they have my ip address and they will come i tell them to let me see it but they say no don't think i'm dumb nice try and i don't know if they do or if it's possible so if y'all know please help

"beautifully passive is a fraud as recent as january, even after reading all the negative reviews my husband and i mistakenly invested in beautifully passive. the salesman, marketing and professional lying -point person jeff rosen,  has an excellent ability to have an answer for everything. i challenged him on all the negative feedback on both reddit and the better business bureau, he told me it was the competition and they get people to post negative experience to deter investors. he also said, ""do you know in order to get an a+ rating on bbb you have to pay a monthly fee"" claiming the beautifully passive business doesn't want to invest in this. he told me they were hugely successful and people were lining up to invest, this is the new ""facebook"" big idea and i don't want to miss out. he said they had investors who are already making money, even referred me to two. the one person michelle sounded real...who knows who she was. when questioned on address, location and owner info, oh yeah he had an answer for that as well. he even went so far as to send me a selfie in front of the office? who knows if it's him or the actual office. the person neal who makes an appearance on here, yup he was used as an example for me, saying he and his wife just happen to be there in florida and the owner (i think paul is his name?) is taking them out for a ""seafood lunch"". it's all a calculated, misguided, lie fueled fraud. now i am out $15,000 dollars because they said it was a ""final sale"" contract. guess what, it doesn't say that anywhere on the contract. the initial invest requirement is $30,000 for 2 fat freezing machines, but because jeff rosen saw my hesitation, he claimed he got ""chewed out"" by the owner for giving me such an amazing opportunity by giving me an option to pay $15,000 instead of the $30,000 and now .... guess what... no machines are available, due to the coronavirus. the machines are manufactured in china. do not fall victim to their lies. now i have to ensue a legal battle to get back my money, but i will get it back. i have clear and non-disputing records via emails and text messages showing their empty promises."

"unpaid internship with *possibility* of a commission without getting into too much details, i was offered another interview with a start-up near my university. they had a posting on indeed.com indicating the tasks i would be doing, all of which were related to my major of study. i also wanted to do the internship in hopes of making valuable connections, although with the company being so unknown and small, i doubt it would offer me useful contacts. their office was located within a business incubator center near my school, and i interviewed there. now the issue i have with this internship is the fact that i don’t get paid for the amount of tasks i’m expected to do: photoshop/adobe, promotions, marketing analysis, etc. in a 20/hr work week. essentially things i’d do in an entry-level marketing job. also, they said there was a possibility of a commission if they get company sponsors. 
to me, it feels like i’ll be doing as much work as a research assistant (who isn’t funded, lol).
what really surprised me was i emailed a “thank you” after my first interview and immediately got a response saying i got offered a second interview at so-and-so date/time. never happened to me before and sounds like they wanted me that bad. i personally don’t think it’s a scam altogether, but the nature of the internship is literally slave labor for a start up who has no funds to pay people working for them. oh also i don’t buy their “offer of a paid position” bs because again, they’re a start-up with barely any funds.
any thoughts and opinions? this is the first time i’ve interviewed for an unpaid internship and i honestly think all unpaid internships should offer at least a food and transportation stipend."

"how to avoid batik tapestry scam in yogyakarta so i’m in yogyakarta traveling at the moment. i was just scammed and i want everyone to know about this.

yogyakarta (or jogjakarta or yogya or jogja) is an awesome city. lots of great food and cool areas.

the city is also the origin of the amazing [batik tapestries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/batik). these are highly coveted works of art so there is a scam that a lot of people do to rope on tourists.

here’s what happened to me:

my friend and i stopped to eat at a fried tofu stand in malioboro. while eating, a man also eating there struck up a conversation with us. he spoke remarkably good english. we were talking about batik and he told us that he himself is an artist. great news!

we followed him to a gallery on a side alley of the main drag. inside was a beautiful array of paintings on cotton. [here is an example](https://imgur.com/gallery/wsddz55) of some of the paintings or things we found inside.

the man and another painter inside explained to us how they make the batik and brought us tea. we browsed around and enjoyed our time. this was the first of our four days in jogja and we wanted to see more places before purchasing anything. i assumed we would return the following day. i asked our friend when they open the following day.

here is where i started to get red flags (and realize all the ones i already missed). he told me they are packing up tomorrow for sumatra to exhibit their paintings there. today would be **the final day to buy any of these**. i realized that a man guiding us here—to a side alley no less—was the first clue i should have gotten.

they had answers for all my questions: how will i tell a real from a fake batik? how long does it take to make? can i see where you do it? *(not in the gallery)* and on and on.

the original price he gave us for a small painting was 850,000 rupiah ($60 usd/€54). with haggling we got him down to 600,000. eventually as we decided we wanted out, he dropped it to both of our paintings for 600,000 (so 300,000 each). that was it and we left.

later, our hostel told us that the paintings were actually painted, and not just printed. and the designs were actually really cool. but the price that many tourists pay is *way too high*. a good, authentic batik should never cost 850,000 unless it is huge!

we were not the first tourists to have this scam run on us; i’m [not even the first to write about it](https://www.jackandjilltravel.com/batik-scammers-yogyakarta/). (quick shout out to read this blog post from jack and jill travel.)

just be attentive and aware. the next day i found some incredible and authentic batik for the same price (and much larger). if you’re in jogja, go to [batik winotosastro](https://goo.gl/maps/fur15x5rpjmrzghk7) or just peruse the [beringharjo market](https://goo.gl/maps/zihwubsqjkemm3vea).

things to remember:

-	real batik is more geometric and pattern-based. it does *not* look like a painting in the traditional sense.
-	if an artist seems pushy, don’t buy it.
-	some galleries may exist, but they will never be on a tiny alley. they will be prominently placed.
-	some scammers might tell you their shop is “government-sponsored” and can not negotiate price. this is a lie.
-	if you are told that this is your last chance to buy, leave.
-	most importantly, trust your gut."

not gonna lie, i was a bit shook. i assume your friends and family haven't seen your johnson yet, and so it was all a bluff? when people talk about this particular scam they say nothing happen almost always or most of the time or hardly ever. and at some point you have to consider that you're rolling dice here, because ""hardly ever"" isn't never and ""almost always nothing happens"" isn't nothing happens; there's the implication that someone out there wasn't bluffing and someone did get fucked up.

there's also some other things that i'm curious about; i assume that the ""programme"" would be on my phone, since the email address it was sent is only on my phone; all of my devices have different emails. plus my desktop doesn't have a web cam for this exact reason.

so i'm thinking, could they have it? yes. is it likely? maybe. i don't know what kind of angles they'd really be getting with a phone camera that isn't trying to film? because they couldn't use camera less battle station. 

i'm also curious if what they're proposing is even possible;you can put malware on someone else domain and everyone who comes through will be exposed to it, and those that get infected goon to comendeer your cam, mic and contacts list and send it all back home before you even know it."

so the car is located in germany but the seller is not, he has offered to split the cost of shipping with me with through uship escrow transport service, i've been sent the vin of the car which checks out, he has given me his personal name and adress and offered in person payment.

"everfx global and my experience with it today i stumbled across everfx global i saw it on the news initially on the news on facebook, straight after i signed up on their website i got a phone call from an assistant, the guy seemed to be very helpful and wanted to show me around the website and how to withdraw and add money into my account, he was telling me about all the clients that received a ton of money in the past month and how companies are crashing and how great opportunities are popping up all the time, it all seemed too good to be true and when something seems to be too good to be true it probably is, so i did my research online by research i mean doing a quick google search for the company's name and what i saw was a lot of reviews most of them were blocked by the company for example on on trustpilot the managed to block most of the reviews which is odd. the guy was telling me about using different bank cards and he seemed to be very interested in the bank account that i'm using and getting it through the bank verification step, obviously i didn't put any money in it because it seemed very fake but someone with a little bit less experience in technology or less familiar with scammers would easily fall for it, i think the best thing you can do is just block these guys and not waste your time add money on such a scam.

also a thought just occurred to me and i wanted to check how did i actually stumble across that news article but then, i remembered reading an article about the new microsoft 2020 flight simulator then while scrolling down i saw what belief is another article which was advertised on on the website and it mentioned bitcoin trading and how to sign up it all seems very legit i didn't even question it until now so stay safe guys and watch out for scammers."
"urgent help needed. please help, i'm not sure what to do - throwaway for obvious reasons.

to  summarise, i signed up for a premium snapchat in-app, and once the in-app window closed i had no way to re-access the website that i was on, thus no way to cancel my subscription. it was one of those ""pay a fee now, and cancel your subscription within 2 days or be billed"" kind of things. pretty much, i paid $1, and now have two days to cancel this subscription or else i'll be charged somewhere in the realm of $30 a week. i don't know what my rights are here - and i don't know if it's legal to just transfer all of my money away to another account and forget about it.

for those who can genuinely help if i give specifics, the particular website in question was ""[yellowpremiums.com/melyssa](https://yellowpremiums.com/melyssa)"" (nsfw link). i need to cancel this quickly - the $1 is not an issue, obviously, but the subscription is. i need urgent responses - please help.

also, finally, before you all say it, yes, i am very, very stupid, and this was a huge mistake."

"can someone explain the eventvwr scam to me? i keep getting calls from people trying to scam me, they ask me to push windows r and then run eventvwr. i love messing with scammers but i don’t know what happens after this so i can’t lie about what i see on my screen. i’ve searched online but can’t find anything, does anyone know of a step by step of the scam so i can mess with them for a bit longer."
"pretty sure this one is a scam, but i'm checking just in case. matched with a girl on tinder tonight. she was located about a half mile from my job, so i didn't think too much about it being a scam at first. she asked me to swap to instagram since she was about to ""log off"". that was red flag #1. i figured it would be harmless to just talk, so i agreed. in talking more on insta, she seemed to be a real person at least. she was capable of responding to both basic questions and in depth ones. her english is a touch broken but i know some people who can't be bothered to spell things properly over text so i don't pay much mind to it. when i asked where she worked, she responded, ""i don't work in (my city)"" though she did confirm that she lives here. later on she confessed that she was a cam girl to ""pay for her sister's college and then later her own."" she invited me to see a show she was putting on tonight, and i said yes so i could get the address of the site she was using and look it up. it didn't get the best response when i researched it, so i figure it's a scam. when i told her i wasn't going to be able to watch, she told me she ""cancelled the show"" because i wouldn't be watching. i really wish it wasn't because it would be nice to actually have a date but i'm pretty much convinced this is a scam. am i right here?"
"sextortion from content seller? hi there.

so i was a dumb, lonely, horny bastard and i was browsing omegle and connected with a 19 year old girl on there who was advertising selling her nudes, videos, etc. lots of girls do this today with websites like onlyfans blowing up and i am an occasional buyer. i thought why not see what she has to offer?  i messaged her on kik she verified herself with a live video and she seemed pretty cute. she then messaged her extensive ""menu"" of prices for the content she was selling and we agreed on what i was to buy.

fast forward to me paying for my stuff she claims she is actually 15, that she never said that she herself is 19 (despite very clearly being passably 19 in her verification video and profile picture which were both non-nude), and that she is going to report me unless i ""make things right"". at this point i am freaking the fuck out because i would never under any circumstances do this sort of thing with a minor. she essentially says that i need to pay more or she will report me to the authorities. i ask for proof that she's actually 15 and she refuses to comply saying that i am now harassing a minor. i ended up sending more money and then she says she would let me know if she decides to press charges.

again, let me stress she said she was 19 twice in this exchange. zero pornographic material was exchanged from neither myself or her. she does not know what i look like or what my name is. i have screenshots of the full conversation in case i need to go to the authorities myself. there is clearly zero intent that i sought out a minor but she kept twisting my words and claiming that i'm a pedophile.

still freaking out over this but the more i think on it the less it makes sense. we had used cashapp for the payment and you have to be over 18 to use it. what should my next course of action be? delete kik and never use it again? does she really have any case against me?"
yes hello i would like to know if this is a scam? she said she has my ip address but i don't think so

"forex scam ""game changers"" kuvera towards the start of 2019, i came across this person who followed me on instagram who had a lot of forex posts. as an naive, ambitious person with big goals, i wanted to expand my network and see opportunities. i hit up a guy to tell me about this opportunity. i met up 3 people and met their leader wasiq zia.

his friends later quit and told me wasiq had lied about all his results and manipulated them. i got started the same day as the opportunity sounded amazing. i was part of this scam for over 6 months, and made no money. i had an organization of over 50 people. when i walked away, i still had a good amount of people and could lead it to a profitable network marketing business, but the 6 months i was in this organization had traumatized me and ethically &amp; morally i couldn't continue. all the lies, they used to keep everyone brainwashed. some of my friends i had gotten in this with me also became very depressed finding out all the lies.

i was putting so much money in my forex and everyday their signals were making me lose money, and doing doordash food deliveries to support this venture. i did everything they told me to do, house event, put on my face on stories every day. dm'd 500+ people, uploaded pictures every couples day. when i found all the lies and that no one was actually making money through forex, i became very suicidal. as i had lost friends, and even my family did not like who i was becoming, as i was always show boating on instagram.

**the truth about network marketing is that it is not a 300$ admission to having your own business. you need at least 5 figures saved so you can invest in followers, gucci/ lv stuff so people think your ballin' through forex, but your simply capping.**

**their signals do not work, i will explain at the end why they did not work. please please if you do meet them up. do yourself a favor, ask them to go to their forex account show you at least 1 months trading history. preferably 3-4 months. it only makes sense for you to see something real. and please make sure you see the tag on the mt4 app which says ""real' in a gold emblem/ sign.**

here are some of the lies, rakan khalifa, lily zaremba, lina (iam\_lina1), emmanuel major, kaine harriott.

1. first and foremost their followers are fake. i dont know how delusional lina is to take herself from a few thousand to nearly 50 thousand followers and thinking it looks real. kaine harriott has gone from 12.3k fake followers to 67.3k fake followers since checked his profile about a week ago. while i was there, i was also told to get into this fake follower game by wasiq zia.
2. ig.doust (real forex coach) recently exposed lina, emmanuel major and melissa of having a ""free telegram forex channel"" where they would copy and paste ig.doust forex signals for his company. these guys do not understand forex and this proved it. i had previously thought emmanuel major was good at forex but the fact that they were illegally stealing ig.doust forex signals proved how illiterate they are.
3. this isn't a lie i am about to expose. game changers have had to move away from canada, and explore markets in different countries to scam. a guy named mathew fernandez, ig: mfernz57 left kuvera first week of 2020(he joined kuvera mid-2018). he left with his entire team of 600+people preaching 'morals over money' due to all the lies, scamming, and brainwashing in kuvera/game changers. **their name is tarnished across toronto, mississauga, brampton and other cities in the greater toronto area in ontario.**
4. lily once lead a campaign showing how she made 10k cad in one day of trading. anyone who understood forex and saw her performance knew she was crazy. she was using insane leverage, she was doing this for months and months and would show how(on our leadership chats) on a regular day she would be a couple thousand in the negatives. using the leverage she was, she was simply playing with her luck, well she did ""win"" 10k in 1 day. well, i am here to expose this bullshit. did you know she then went on to blow her entire account away literally a few days later.
5. kuvera got a new owner in october 2019. a lot of people quit since then, teams in a whole country(mexico, japan, singapore etc) all quit. i am not 100% sure but i believe the compensation plan was brutally changed. also they had changed their titles on what they were earning, now rakan khalifa was a 100k/month earner and mathew fernandez was a 50k/month earner. **mathew fernandez told us that he was getting paid 3k/month in reality**. all this was just manipulation tactics. ""i make upto 100k/month"" is not a thing. like who sets these caps to income? these were just manipulation tactics.
6. now anthony napolitano (itzanthonynap) has a forbes article on him. well, unless you are elon musk, forbes will not write on you. so how is this possible? just go on fiver and search up ""get published on forbes"" and you'll bet talking to a forbes writer. when you have less money to spend, you buy the 300$ package to get published on forbesindia as anthony did. you can get published on [forbes.com](https://forbes.com) as well but you need $5k+. why these articles are bs as when you search ""anthony napolitano"", this article will never pop up as when forbes legitimately writes on you, they post on social media and people actually go on it, therefore google recommends this article. as for anthony's article, it will never pop up unless you search, ""anthony napolitano forbes"" or directly get the link. the forbes article is simply to brag and further add to his manipulation tactics.
7. if you want more dirt on these guys, if i haven't provided enough. here are some notable people who are ex-kuvera members. they quit following mathew fernandez ""morals over money"" slogan. they are, joshua baril (ig: joshuanatsu) , rahaman waheed (ig: rahamanwaheed), and basil paul varghese (basil\_paul\_varghese). they are now in a different company under mathew fernandez.

i have been writing this for an hour and i hope this helps you. please please, do not fall for their scam, i have lost sleep, been depressed, and lost enough money. i was doing around 20 hours doordash/week to fund forex and then lose it all. i would not have money for food. for months and months i survived on a 4$/day diet.

to end it off on a good note, i did start my own online company and have taken it to a 6-figure company, i am doing a lot better financially and mentally. no lol, i am not associated with any of these companies nor do i do not have a course or any of that bs.

**i do not recommend mathew fernandez team as well. if you truly believe 'money over morals' why did you leave only when your pay got slapped.**

i believe most of these guru's are full of shit and do not care about you, ex. kevin david, one of the biggest online scammers, he has enough dirt on him online

if this does get viewed, get comments i will release more proof on kuvera/game changer's scam. i have a month or two of chat history in their leadership chats."

"is this an attempted scam? i probably should say ""i'm pretty sure this is a scam, but not sure how."" i offered a big, heavy piece of furniture for sale for $250 on some online site. i got a reply asking about it and what the low price was. i said $250. he said he would buy it and have ""his shipper"" (his term) ship it to him.   

red flag 1 (maybe): not local. now, this piece would have sold for $7k new \~10 years ago. and while it's in very good shape, it's not as ""trendy"" as it was then. we know $250 is a really good price (we just want it gone) so it's not out of the question that a furniture reseller would be able to pay me, have it shipped, and still sell it for a profit.  

he said he would send a cashier's check. and his instructions were that ""once the check has cleared"" i was to contact his shipper and make arrangements. and the check would be for $250 + shipping costs. i'd think that it would not be unusual for someone in that business to have a shipper that he regularly does business with, so.. ok. maybe red flag 2, maybe not. he even stipulated ""once check has cleared"".  

my radar is active and my spider sense is tingling, but i'm unsure how he'd be scamming me (assuming he actually is and is not legit... more on that later). what damage or problems might i encounter if i deposit a cashier's check and then wait, say, 10 days? or 15. or whatever period of time is appropriate. is there a way to be 100% certain the check has cleared and won't come back to bite me?  in another line of thought, is there some way he can get info about the bank account i deposit the check into?  

i do plan on asking (via text, in a casual manner) about why he's wanting such a big piece shipped... does he own a furniture business... if so what is the name.... etc. just to see what other info i can glean.  i also plan on contacting the bank listed on the cashier's check before doing anything with it to verify the account and funds. if i get super lucky and it's a bank with a local branch, i'll pay them a visit.  

anyway, that's the story. as i said, i'm unsure what problems he could cause me besides the cashier's check ending up being invalid.

thanks for your input!"
"target cashback after purchase, is this a scam? so i got this message on my facebook messenger. i am half-sure it is a scam but could not figure out how it works. 

so here are the steps:

1. you place an order on target/macys.
2. once it is delivered you contact me.
3. the store sends you full refund including shipping and taxes.
4. you pay me 50% of refund amount to my paypal.

your guarantees:

- product will be delivered to your hands.
- if you aren't sure about my service, you can easily send it back and get normal refund.
- i don't ask any prepayments, you pay me only after you get money back.

anyway you don't get risk 😉

how is this even possible?"

"encounter with c3 workshop. maybe a scam. not 100% sure. i'm 18, and i was 17 at the time this happened. i'm a high school senior. a few weeks ago i went to a c3 workshop presentation with my two parents, hosted at a hilton hotel. it's nothing new for me. i've been too dozens of these information about college/about cash for college workshops that are hosted at a variety of highschools/actual colleges/unis/ whatever. maybe the hotel setting was weird, but two years ago, i attended a national art portfolio day that was hosted at a killer hotel, so i didn't think it odd.

now, we got this letter in the mail. we didn't think much about it. we always get emails about college workshops.

we go, and there's like a dozen other students. they give a presentation that gives off a tone of ""university is a big deal. you don't wanna waste time and money"" which yeah i get, but i feel like people shouldn't pressured to not fail. like yeah, don't be a dumbass, but at the same time, it's okay if you don't live your life like it's a checklist.

that's kinda besides the point, but they interview each student individually. they advertised this ""amazing"" website that will practically give you amazing scholarships, and free tutoring. i'm thinking it's too good to be true.

finally, they interview my parents and me. the woman looks at my gpa and achievements and everything that we were instructed to put down on a sheet. she says i am an amazing student, and all that. she makes it seem like the website is a once in a life time thing, and i need to enroll now. the catch is that it is like $1,700 to make an account.

maybe the website is worth that price, but i think you should advertise that on the letter instead of springing it on an unsuspecting family. we're not poor, but my parents have other things to worry about concerning cash

needless to say, our family doesn't have money to throw around. the woman didn't let us leave until she told us to come back the next day. we didn't. we celebrated my birthday that day. 

that was pretty scammy."

so i'm trying to get out of a potiential scam relating to seeking arrangements. the ""guy"" claims he is a fbi officer and asking for a 1000$ in cash but i haven't paid him yet at all. should i report this to the action to fbi or should i block his number and pray for the worse or change my number? someone help me."
"fbi and kiddie porn this happened about 12 years ago but it was pretty disturbing. i was messing around on the computer one day when suddenly a window opened up with a very official looking fbi page. in one corner of the page was a small window showing a real time image of me from my web cam. the page said that unknown to me a criminal enterprise had been using my computer to distribute child pornography to many different countries. it also said that unless i paid a fine of $350.00 (i think that was the amount) the fbi would put out a federal warrant for my arrest in 12 hours and convict me to the fullest extent of the law. it also said until i paid this fine my computer would stay locked on that page. in another section it gave me instructions on how i could pay my fine which involved me buying some kind of money card, calling some number and giving them the money card details. i tried to get away from that page and research this but my computer was completely frozen on that page. even when i shut it down and restarted it that same fbi page would pop back up. 

okay from the beginning i knew this was some kind of scam because they gave themselves away in several ways. #1 was how could i be convicted if someone used my computer to commit a crime without my knowledge? #2 was getting any fed. gov office of any kind to accomplish anything in just 12 hours was extremely unlikely. #3 was a gov. agency seizing my computer electronically or any other way without a physical court order being given to me was again extremely unlikely. #4 was the thought of the fbi accepting money-gram cards over the phone in any capacity was again extremely unlikely. ah hell you get the picture, unless their a very gullible person no one would fall for this.

i finally had to restore my computer to an old save point, from before i somehow dled the virus,to get it back in working order. the very first thing i did was go to the fbis website to their internet scam section and the very first scam listed was the one that got me. i reported what little i knew about the scam to them and that was that. oh yeah, who ever set that scam up must have went to the fbis web page and copied it because the page that popped up when my computer froze was an exact copy in its layout."

"anyone have an account closed after getting scammed? my bank - i won't name names yet, as i plan on writing a detailed account of the entire fiasco - closed five of my accounts a week ago. after holding my funds hostage for a week with zero information, i finally got someone on the phone to tell me it was because i deposited a bad check into one of the accounts way back in october. funds are still in limbo, but at least now i know why.

in october, i lost $2,000 because i fell for a stupid scam, which involved depositing what turned out to be a bad check into one of my bank accounts. i paid the stupid bank fee. i moved on. 

without warning, four months later, the bank closed my accounts - two of which belong to my adult children, which is not only unfair to them, should never have happened. none of the accounts should have ever been closed without warning, but that's for another post.

my question: has anyone else had their account closed because they deposited a scam check? do you mind sharing details? i’d be equally interested in hearing if you deposited a bad check, and subsequently had any positive, supportive experiences from your bank. 

there is a bigger story here: you pay the returned check fee, you remain loyal (in my case, for 20 years before this crap!), you lose money from a scam, and then the bank adds insult to injury. **surprise**:  *your debit card is rejected.* **surprise**: *we're holding your funds.* **surprise**: *your life insurance payment isn't going to post because the account is closed.* **go find another bank.** *oh, you need money to put in that new account?* **ha!** *we have your money!*

yep, the terms &amp; conditions say that banks can do this. yep, i deposited a bad check. yep, i'm one of the 30+ million adults a year - more than 15% of american adults - that falls victim to fraud. but the last thing you need after the potentially devastating aftereffects of losing money is the bank that you’ve been loyal to dropping you without warning. there has to be a better way.

if you have a story to share, please do. i'll be posting my saga in a few days."

now, my bike is a bit of a collector's piece, but it's 20 years old.  it's unique, so it's not unusual to go for more than kbb, but this seems a bit too easy of a transaction.  who buys a classic bike, sight unseen? note that i did specify cash only in my ad.   how can i respond to determine whether this is a legit offer or a scam?"

"real estate scam? my father owns the house my sister is living in.  she is chronically short on making various payments to him, so he wants out.  property is worth $220k.

she found a ""contractor"" who flips houses who sent him a contract for $170k cash and a lease agreement that will allow her to stay in the house rent free for five years after the contractor buys the house.

both sister and dad think it's a great deal because the guy ""seems like he knows what he's talking about"".  both sister and dad are notoriously bad judges of character and have each been the victims of various scams over the years. 

aside from dad taking a huge loss on the property, is there some other angle in this?  can an agreement for five years of free rent hold up if the guy decides to dump the property in six months?"

"pcp doctor office scam? i have a feeling i got duped a 2nd time. years ago i chose a pcp with insurance for a doctor a few minutes from my house. the first time i got there the doc was not in and i saw another doctor. i found out the doctor i chose retired but they were still using his name as the pcp, but had other docs see me. shady stuff.

now i'm on medi-cal via caloptima and chose another pcp. i asked to make an appointment with my pcp specifically and nobody else. i got to the office and he was not there. i made a remark but was in pain so continued.  2nd time i came in the doctor was not in either. he has multiple offices and i think he doesnt work out of this one. is this another scam where they list a good doctor as pcp for a location just to reap the benefits of his name? i have a feeling he is never in this office.

"php agency? anyone heard about it? costs 200 to join, and you get a license to sell insurance. they sell iul which this explains it :  [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insurance/09/indexed-universal-life-insurance.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insurance/09/indexed-universal-life-insurance.asp) 

the guy told me that the iul he sells has a 100% participation rate. if that's the case, i'm honestly much more interested in the actual iul they're selling than actually joining the company. he told me that they just opened up in my town, and that nobody knows about iuls, so now is the best time to join since it's apparently such a good deal. 

&amp;#x200b;

he said for their iuls, you pay 250 a month for a 500 k life insurance policy. that 250/month also gets put into a cash value amount, that is credited based on increases in equity indexes (tax free) from the stock market you or they pick. the cash value can apparently be withdrawn at any time, and the 500 k upon death is also not subject to death or income taxes. it honestly sounds like a decent way to build up for retirement, especially if he's being truthful about the 100% participation rate."

"port-out scam today i just became the victim to a port-out scam. 

this morning, i got a text from my phone service provider saying they've received a request to transfer my telephone number to another service provider. since i have received numerous scam texts impersonating my carrier in the past, i thought nothing of it, since i figured, oh! if someone's going to transfer my phone to another carrier, i've got to at least receive a call or a legit email from carrier, right? wrong. apparently all it took for them to gain access to my phone is my full name, address, and postal code (i spoke to 2 customer service reps from my carrier today, both of whom relied on that bit of info to authenticate me). if i don't contact the carrier and say, ""i have a problem with you changing my carrier info!"", then the change is going to take place pretty much immediately. 

from there, by taking over my phone number, the scammer gained access to my email and online banking. they first hooked up my account with western union (why does it always have to be western union smh) and transferred a sum of around $1000 cad. they  found a recipient listed in my online banking that has my email, which they then sent the remaining funds on my account to. they logged onto my email, used that link to deposit money into their account (it's a lot of money). i woke up around the time they were just finishing up and managed to cancel one transaction. i also got in touch with my bank's cybercrime investigation service within the hour of the deposit.

i am currently using one of the biggest phone service providers in canada, and it is truly disappointing that their lack of authentication competence has caused their customers to be targeted, their personal information compromised, and is somehow generating income for criminals."

"help i think i've been scammed. i called him out on it and he's threatening to send me to jail.. is that possible? i'm so stupid. please hold back judgement, i know i messed up, i don't know why i kept listening to him, and i'm really freaking out. i don't know what to do or what he could send me to jail for.

for backstory, he was messaging as a sugar daddy (definitely not true) offering money if i helped him out with his business. he said he was a former soldier and had a business selling gift cards to soldiers oversees. i was purchasing gift cards on credit cards he had me sign up for, all in my name. i sent him pictures of gift cards and he said he would pay off the card balances. i asked how this would work because i didn't think someone else could pay these off. everytime he tried the payment would be returned. all my card are cancelled now because they were maxed out and payments were being returned. 

he said he was going to fix things by sending a check that i could deposit in my account so i could pay off the cards with my own account. but he sent me a checkbook in my name from some bank and an account that i don't know. he said he added me to the account and i was authorized to use it. god i'm so stupid, but i made out a check to myself and deposited it. he told me to write one way over what the cards were because then i could keep helping him. after i deposited he was pressuring me to use the money right away because some was available. i held him off waiting for the check to clear. and he wanted me to withdraw almost all of it right away. 

i called the bank this morning to verify and like i suspected, they told me i'm not listed on the account and should not have been able to write the check. the guy i talked to said they started filing a fraud report. i told them the money is currently still in my account and i'm not touching it so it can be returned. they also said they would contact the owners of the account to inquire about this.

the scammer doesn't know i've called the bank. he kept telling me to withdraw the money. he's always saying if i don't follow instructions or if i make him mad he'll reverse the check an i'll be on my own to make credit card payments. i've accepted i'm not getting anything from him and will lose on the credit cards, but now he's saying i'm stealing from him if i don't withdraw the money. he says i'm in possession of his business investment funds and i should be prepared to suffer the consequences. ""you've brought war and trouble on yourself"", ""you'll regret this and pay with your blood for it. see that as a threat"", ""you'd prefer jail when i'm done with you""... he keeps calling me greedy for not doing what he says when i haven't profited a cent off of this. and i keep asking him what i did, what law i've broken and he says  ""when you're there [in jail] if i get a chance to talk to your greedy ass i'll tell you what you did""

and lastly ""i guess you're ready to go to jail along with other consequences. i hope your parents will miss you. you've brought doom on yourself.""


is this real? what could he have me arrested for? i know i must seem really stupid and gullible, but i need some reassurance there isn't some twisted way he could find a way to send me to jail. sorry for the rant. i'm really freaked out and i don't know what more to do."

"rapidmind solutions inc - stephen and mandie nickerson - scammers to whom this may concern,
 
in early 2018, stephen nickerson started promoting an opportunity to earn a passive income without having to do any work. steve nickerson, who is the founder and ceo of rapidmind solutions inc., conducted webinars, which were promoted through other individuals close to him. on the webinars he was explaining how his system, called automagic, would give financial freedom by combining network marketing, internet marketing, affiliate marketing, and done-for-you sells. he sold 4 marketing packages:
silver (price tag: ~$4,000usd), $5228.63 cad
gold (price tag: ~$8,000 usd), $10,457.27 cad
platinum (~$16,000usd), and $20,914.54 cad
diamond (~$20,000), $26,143.18 cad
diamond was the highest level. together with these packages, a customer would need to make a commitment to purchase 150 pv (app. 190usd) of doterra products per month for a period of one year.

the total investment for the member (i.e. enrollee in the system) would consist of:
1- an initial program fee (as listed above depending on the package).
2- purchase a every oil kit or diamond kit from doterra, worth $1950usd.
3- twelve (12) months products from doterra (worth around 190usd/month including the shipping totaling around 2,250usd).

stephen nickerson assured the investors that the program included an “one-year money-back guarantee,” meaning that if the program failed to fulfill the investors, he would refund the investment amount. he held many webinars over the course of the one year insisting that the program had already worked. he enrolled members who would promote the program aggressively (e.g. linda chan and eric chan, shawn branson and a few others). some of these names are listed at the bottom of this letter, indicating their position in the company as well.
 
stephen nickerson, together with his team kept promoting and stating that all an enrollee would need to do was to choose one of the four done-for-you marketing packages, called automagic, and ensure a monthly order of doterra products worth at least 150pv (personal volume) for a period of at least 12 months.  this would result in the program giving the enrollees (i.e. investors) financial freedom.
 
they would present doterra's compensation program, and describe how automagic would help build an enrollee’s system without having to ever sell doterra products to earn a commission.  they also insisted, the system would work within 6 months.
 
after joining the program, stephen set up a private facebook messenger group titled “automagic q&amp;a” for all investors to share information on.  many promoted the program and reiterated the benefits. as an example, linda chan was extremely active in the group, sharing information and answering queries almost on a daily basis. however, communication on the facebook chat group stopped on november 16, 2018.  no webinar or communication was sent to members.  communication started again on december 4, 2018.  a new member of the automagic team was introduced, nate lindquist.  he was introduced as the “advisor to the ceo.”  there were several investors who wrote in the chat group that they were concerned that no one was added to their downline, as promised by the program, which was the promise made.
 
after members questioning the process, the messages started having a different tone and (nasty).  on december 22, 2018, stephen nickerson shut down the group chat and all communication effectively stopped for several weeks. finally on january 1st, 2019, the members received an automagic email. refer to the email for reference.
 
since then many investors started asking for a refund and contacted the company members (through various channels).  each time the members were asked to show patience, and that stephen nickerson and his team were working tirelessly to meet the agreement.  
 
 
by mid-2019, many investors had reached their 12 months period with automagic, and started asking for a refund.  stephen communicated that he was sorry automagic had not worked as promised. he also shared with us that doterra had forced them to shutdown automagic for 6 months. stephen had not communicated this earlier and apologized for failing to inform that of the program, and for violating doterra's company compliance.  the company started limiting the communications and started residing on email communications at this point.
 
when the company failed in delivering the guarantee, the team created a second program called 4friends through a new company called freedom hack collective. stephen nickerson has promised the automagic members a refund when new members would join. they openly stated that automagic had run out of money and would pay the old members with the money they would take in from new members. this is the very definition of a pyramid scheme. they basically were going to take money from others to pay others.
 
this group of individuals are liable for this pyramid scheme, in which they promised to refund the investment an enrollee would make.
 
in the attached excel sheet, documents related to the pyramid scheme can be found.
 
based on an estimation (attached excel sheet), the members made a total investment of $2,976,000 usd in the program. this is based on a total of 260 members stated by stephen nickerson in a webinar.
 
in this program, the following people were working directly or promoting it:
stephen nickerson (founder)
mandie nickerson (stephen’s wife and doterra wellness advocate)
nate lindquist (online marketing consultant)
shawn branson (coo)
kenneth aaron ignatius (customer service director)
galina lipina (affiliate manager)
scott smythe
joe moulton (ceo - former ceo)
linda ngo-chan (affiliates)
eric chan (affiliates)
we are bringing your attention to this pyramid scheme and we hope you look into it and help the customers to get a refund of our money and set a stop to this scam that continues luring new victims.
 
warm regards,
victims of the scam program"
i don’t one a chase bank account but i recently got this should i be worried ? 
"am i being scammed or is this just a strange deal? i posted my vehicle on craigslist about a week ago an an individual has asked a few questions before launching into the following email:
 
 
“thank you so much for your response, i've been working really long weeks at work so i won't be able to meet with you before purchase, but am ok with the price and condition as shown on the advert, i'll proceed in issuing a check to you and when you receive the payment and it clears, i will make  arrangement for pickup. so get back to me with below details asap.

full name :
physical address (only,not po box):
city, state, zip:
your cell phone number:
deal price:

as soon as this is provided, payment will be overnight to you through ups next day delivery and i will let you know then tracking number of the package. i will also add an additional $50 for keeping other buyers off till my check gets to you, also please delete the posting or mark as sold.”
 
reading all that... i’m not sure what to think. i don’t think i will be interested in dealing with this individual even if it’s not a scam, but i would like to know if this is a really weird scam or just a strange deal.
 
i was thinking it might be a fake check scam but that wouldn’t make much sense since i could easily delay seeing the buyer until the check failed to clear properly. if it is a scam can anyone guess their plan?"
"can i buy bitcoin for someone somebody is asking me to buy bitcoin for him. he said he will interac me the money, i have to go to bitcoin atm and have to send him back. he will give me 5% of every money he send to me. can i do that?"
"have you guys ever had a scammer come back for a second time after they failed? hey guys had a scammer somehow hit me up on multiple emails over a year ago, deleting the emails solved the problem, but i can’t help but wonder if they will ever try the same stunt again. have you guys had any experiences like this?"
"please help, i got scammed of $900 back in december of 2019, i found a page that sold sneakers and other stuff. the prices were not too good to be true; they were near market value, just a bit under enough for me to buy. his insta was gotdatresell (now changed to resellbruh after blocking me). i saw his refs, nearly 2k followers and decent number of refs and hit him up. we made a deal for $900, only for him to take my money and block me. paid him via google and apple pay. after the money was lost, i immediately went to google and apple for help. nothing. then went to my bank, only to find out a few days ago that all my claims were denied. now i don't know what to do. i only know his general location since he logged into my venmo (different story) and his discord. considering fiiling a police report but i need more info on what to do since i'm just  a college student. please help."

"than merrill’s fourtune builders -my experience/opinion! - stay away! 
tldr: joined fb for free, learned about sales, realized fortune builders is a huge waste of money and a bunch of sleazy salesmen. going to school to be an m.d.

disclaimer:  i’m not saying no one becomes successful from this program i’m sure there are people here and there that actually make something of it and even less who manage to become financially free because of it. but as for 99.99%, they are throwing their time and money into a shredder in my opinion. also note this is 100% my opinion based on my knowledge of sales, real estate, and psychology. also, the only reason for writing this is because i have a lot of free time on my hand and would like to tell others who may be considering it my experience! i feel like this would be the best place to post it since lots of people come here wanting to learn about real estate! i don’t care if you read it or not! also, i don’t care if you agree or not, let me know if you have any questions or you have had a different or similar experience.


let me know if you have any questions or comments or notice any inconsistencies i will happily answer anything if you take the time to read haha!

here’s my experience with fortune builders which i will refer to as fb: i was in college not doing so well (for the second time) 1.2 gpa at age 18, still young dec 2017 (21 at the time of writing). a good friend had come to me and his mother had recently passed leaving him and his father behind. upon her passing, my friend's father who was 59 at the time had inherited a lot of money from retirement funds and life insurance policies. it was a substantial amount of money possibly 250-750k maybe more. the father who we will call f has always been keen on real estate investing and had gone to than merrill’s “three-day real estate workshop” a few years ago. you’ve probably heard it on the radio occasionally, it goes something like this:

“hi than merrill here star of a&amp;es hit tv show flip this house...we are looking for a small group of motivated individuals from \*insert big city name here\* to join our real estate investing team.... if you want to learn how to make money flipping houses and create long term wealth with income properties right here in the \*insert big city name here\* area come out to our free 2-hour educational workshop where you can learn how to start”

anyway, my best friend at the time who we will call c had mentioned something out of the blue to f about wanting to get involved in real estate investing. (keep in mind he was not doing well in school at all either worse than me somehow) and he thought he might bring up the idea to his father knowing that they have inherited a large sum of money. f has been to the free workshop years ago but at the time not having enough money to pay for the real estate system was excited to hear about c’s shared interest. right then and there he told his son about it and they planned to attend another one. f told c that he wanted him to pick one friend that would be an asset to the team and who has the same interest. c had known i had been discouraged in the collage also and i was looking for something bigger. c came to me and invited me to the workshop and told me his dad would pay for everything and that his father would only ask me to repay my fraction when and if we started making money. i literally had nothing to lose and everything to gain in my mind.

a few weeks pass and c, f and i are sitting in the free educational “workshop” that was just a massive sales pitch going on about how great the system is and the success stories. very convincing to be honest... i still had lots of doubts. the sales pitch was 100% expected but we had to attend in order to gain access to the 3-day workshop where we would actually learn a little about real estate and then the programs they offer. the free 2-hour “workshop” concluded with everyone being invited to the 3-day workshop which note costs $300 per person to attend. thankfully f covered the cost of c and i.

as i noted prior f has been to the 3-day workshop so he knows exactly what to expect, but again we need to attend this workshop in order to gain accesses to the “revolutionary business system that then and his friends created that helped them make it in real estate and they wanted to give to us”. this workshop was 9-5 daily fri-sun. this 3-day event was a room filled with 200-300 people and nothing really but a “super-sales pitch” 3 days of the best sales team i’ve ever seen in my life twisting and spewing information acting like they have found the key to heavens gates and the room was eating it up and to be honest i was too but again “nothing to lose everything to gain” i was just excited about everything about to happen in my life. for two and a half days they went on about the system and made real estate investing seem impossible without the system.

at the end of the third day after 2 and a half days of “this is an investment for the future” “this is an investment for your education” “investment investment investment” “the system is an investment that will change your life” they did the big reveal: the cost of the program. f had already told me how much it was going to be for the tier we wanted and there were 3 tiers- 1st was around $20,000 tier2 - 35,000 tier 3 was $50,000 immediately 80% of the room got up and headed for the door astounded to have paid $300 per person and walk away empty-handed and have paid to be sold to. and i’m not sure why but c f and i had a quick laugh about that fact. as if we were somehow better then them. btw we were already set on the 3rd tier it came with the most benefits and was the most bang for our buck option.

this is where things start to get kinda iffy that made me question how legit these people are: so those who choose to stay where escorted back to the hallway to wait outside the interview room where we would speak to a coach about joining the program and we would have to get “accepted” and they made it really known that you had to be “accepted” one of the coaches even told us a story while we waited to be interviewed about how the guy with white hair sitting behind us was a lawyer who “could’ve written all kinds of numbers in his checkbook” was denied because he was deemed “untrainable” witch was a huge red flag to me considering we were sitting in the very last row and the only thing behind me was the wall. i caught that but i don’t believe c or f did they were too excited to get into the interview room and write a $50,000 check and start their future as real estate investors and hey so was i! everything to gain! nothing to lose!

btw i knew the being accepted part was huge bs and was just a sales tactic to make it seem exclusive this is a tactic i had used extensively to sell. if someone hands me or you a check for $20,000-$50,000 we are taking it!

we were given a 300-page book to use at the 3-day workshop with the powerpoint slides and spaces to take notes and it has examples of contracts and all. and i happened to set my book upside down on my lap and on the back in very small writing it stated “earnings and income disclaimers. any income or earnings statements are estimates of income potential only, and there is no assurance that your earnings will match the figures we present” but again i did not pay much attention to the red flags because everything to gain nothing to lose! however, it didn’t stop me from questioning the interviewer. i had one question that i knew would catch him off guard. i figured i’m my head institutions have graduation rates and job rates that determine what percentage of students go on to go to university from high school and from university to a career job. so i asked the coach during the interview “what’s your student success rate how many students actually achieve their goals using this program” and he froze for a second and laughed and explained “you can’t put a number on success” and c and f ate it up and laughed at the silliness of my question too. i believed i had asked a completely logical question and that was one of the biggest red flags. but hey everything to gain!! nothing to lose!! something also funny happened after this, the interviewers were “coaches” and the main presenter for the big 200-300 person event was the “mastery coach”. as soon as we were accepted and went back into the presentation room with the rest of the crowd after the 15 min intermission the “mastery coach” or should i say “master salesman” addressed my question to the entire 200-300 person crowd “you can't put a number on success” and all the other coaches or should i say “salesmen” joined along with him followed by the crowd. it seems they meet up after the interviews and discuss how they can combat pushback and sell by avoiding logical questions.

btw also note: “coaches” are people who have become successful using the system and they are “proven, real estate veterans”

during the last intermission we found out we got accepted and we were super ecstatic and we went and sat back into the seminar room and were congratulated and we set up what was called “full immersion” where accepted student would learn all the ins and outs of how the program works and what we can expect and gave us a basic rundown of everything. here we were assured “the sales pitch was over” by our full immersion coach. red flag: i was talking to the full immersion coach one on one and he happened to pull out his phone and i was confused he pulls out a cracked iphone 5s in 2018. a phone from 2014. “aren’t you supposed to be successful?” i wondered in my head. he saw i noticed his phone and he said “yea i’m not good with tech i don’t care what kind of phone i have”- “don’t you use all of the computer programs to run your real estate business that you are teaching me to use?” i thought to myself but again: everything to gain! nothing to lose!

one thing that came with the membership was we could attend workshops all around the country and there were 3 different workshops to attend... you had to attend them in a certain order which was a little confusing at first but they were “prereqs” according to the coaches.

a few months later when one hit a local city we attended our first of the 3 workshops and this was the most diabolical part of their plan: what they did was they molded the real estate business system in a way that you would have to purchase the programs and services and software they created and sold required to run your real estate business.

the sleaziest part is that they always had these companies outside in the lobby that would help us with buying or signing up to these services making you assume they were 3rd party companies not affiliated with them, which i knew was bs because all of their logos had the same exact style and each of the representatives had very similar if not the same sales style. they acted like it was optional to use these programs and services but they didn’t teach you any other way. the cost ranged from $249/mo for one service to 1300 for another service, plus 3600 for another for 6000 and one for $16000. but the thing is here we were already $50000 in the hole. we are too far into back out now. so we paid for the services +25ish grand plus monthly fees coming out to somewhere around 75000 (which eventually grew to 100k+) to start our business only to have no money so far. nothing to lose! everything to gain!!

this is a sales tactic i’m also familiar with. think about it like this:

you buy a $50 flashlight, great, now the bulb is sold separately for $15 but hey u already spent $50 heck what’s another $15? you've spent so far $65 but wait for the batteries! $5 for the batteries. what’s another $5 you have already spent $65??? you are now at $70! but wait the batteries died, okay. so just pay $5/month subscription for your batteries because you’ve already spent $70 on it $5 is nothing in the grand scheme of things! 6 months go by and you have spent 100% more then you were planning to spend…. the worst thing about fb was that they didn’t tell you that you needed batteries and lightbulbs to operate the expensive flashlight they were selling. and here is something possibly worse… they wouldn’t make you aware of this until your 14-day refund period is over!

now months go by and nothing. we are making 0 progress with buying our first house and finding leads even though we follow the system flawlessly and relentlessly and talking to coaches daily.

i’ve never worked so hard for anything in my life because i knew if i failed at this i wouldn’t be able to go to college with my 1.2 gpa. we all kind of fall dormant in the business for months. during this time i took a sales job and learned all the ins and outs of sales and sales psychology. even though i was not selling real estate i gained a lot of knowledge on advanced psychological sales tactics and how to talk to people and make things seem better then they may be without lying if you can see what i’m saying.

more months go by and we get a call from our coach who is supposedly our main motivation source besides each other and we explain how nothing is progressing and we are working day and night but nothing is coming through despite using what we’ve learned to it’s the fullest extent. he recommends us to another coach and we had never talked to another coach but a few weeks later we are on the phone with another coach we “specialized in our problem areas” and there was something very odd about this phone call he used some of the exact same phrases, comments, and material word for word as if the all the coaching calls were scripted. i tested this theory on my own by going behind my teams back and calling yet a 3rd coach and asking the same exact questions and sure enough, she responded word by word exactly what i expected her to respond with.

a few months go by and another workshop comes to town. by this point, i have 9-10 months of sales experience from my job and know most of the ins and outs i was consecutively a top earner in my region so i know my sales tactics. at this point, i’m still working strenuously with the real estate business with my partners trying to get everything to work

march 2019

we head to the workshop and halfway through the first day i had a revaluation every single aspect of this real estate program is a huge intricate diabolical sales tactic to bleed unsuspecting victims’ wallets, retirements and education funds. the only thing that made me realize was my 9-10

months of sales experience. every single word that comes out of the speaker's mouth all has a single purpose whether the students realized it or not. it was purely to sell, or it was a precursor to an underhand sales pitch yet to come. it was astounding to see how psychology could be used to sell to people and fool people into thinking they are learning something or gaining access to great things.

the worst part was at this workshop about 90% of the crowd was new students and when they learned about the prices of the services and programs, they needed to use the system they were completely discouraged. the looks on some of the family’s faces after their programs and services consulting session was heartbreaking, one woman even admitted to me that she thinks she has made a huge mistake and i felt like a doctor telling a child with a terminal illness that everything will be fine just keep pushing. it was that day i decided to walk away from the massive sales pitch.

from everything i went through with fb i wouldn’t recommend it; it was evident in my eyes that they were just selling the idea of success to people who unlike me weren’t skeptical and weren’t familiar with advanced sales tactics like most people. turns out most of the stuff they taught me was stuff i could just find online for free rather than $50,000. not only this but everything they offered was of poor quality, the videos, the contracts, the events. it seems all the money f paid to fb was used to strengthen their sales tactics and team. i’m grateful for f and his financial sacrifice he made for me as well as c.

today i am 21 years old and have been in college for about a year now, i have managed to retake a lot of courses as well as take a few accelerated courses to catch up and successfully brought my gpa from 1.2 to 3.8. i am currently looking to attend medical school within the next 1-2 years hopefully. i believe the only real way fortune builders helped me personally was by giving me a proper work ethic. it’s bittersweet knowing i pretty much wasted 2-3 years of my young life trying to work with fb, but i don’t regret it because i believe the failure helped in many ways."
"seeking advice (fb marketplace &gt; shipping + paypal?)  i have a roomba listed on facebook marketplace. someone contacted me from a state away asking if im willing to ship. i said sure, but now it comes to how to go about payment. they asked if i do paypal.

my question is this \~ what, if any, is the most protected form of payment for me as a seller?

my initial thoughts with paypal were no \~ i've read tons about people getting scammed. so i began thinking about alternatives. venmo came to mind, i looked into that. seems relatively safe from the sellers side... the majority of posts ive read about people getting scammed are buyer side and that venmo refused do anything about it thereby protecting the seller.

any thoughts or advice?

i posted on /r/flipping and the feedback i got was to just use paypal, send an invoice as goods and services."

"ezbucks.co is a scam  

ezbucks.co is a site that claims to give you: $30 dollars just to sign up, $2 dollars ever time someone clicks on your link, $40 dollars for every app you install, $40 dollars per survey, and $50 dollars for every promotional video that you make for them.  
yeah right let's dig deeper. the site was created in february and people are claiming they gotten paid, there is even little pop ups that say so and so have received thousands of dollars. how is that possible if it is still february and you have to wait 30 days for payment? 

📷

on there site there is no disclaimer or terms and conditions. sound sketch?

in these surveys they are trying to get you info. and sell it probably. 📷

there ""payment proofs"" could easily be photo shopped.

📷

they didn't ask for my tax info. usually when it is legit they ask for your tax info. they didn't take $1 from my paypal to make sure that my paypal was legit.

it's a get rich quick scheme: 📷

the only place i am getting 10 g's is from my 9-5 job, where i clock in and out. which will take months, not less than a week. want money? you need to get off your butt and work for it.

these testimonials sound fake:  📷

there is no way they could afford to pay people this much:

📷

it is definitely a scam."
"almost got scammed by an escort. so i am from the netherlands but currently holidaying somewhere in eastern europe.

before i start i want to clarify that escorts are legal in both countries so i wasn't breaking any laws.

there is some site where you can get the phone numbers of escorts. i had used it one time before and it was ok. today i tried using it again. i contacted a girl and she told me she would be there after 45 minutes. she asked me where i was from and i said the netherlands. i was a bit surprised about

then things started getting weird. she told me to text the hotel name and room number to her. i did so.

then she immediately added on whatsapp and sent me a message if i was alone in my room. then alarm bells started ringing in my head. why would she ask me if i was alone in my room? isn't it obvious? unless she wants to rob me or something and want to make sure that no friend could help me.

i immediately texted her to tell her that i have to go somewhere and let's cancel our date. she first calls me an idiot. then deletes the message and sends another message saying ""i am already in taxi"". i said sorry let's cancel. then she says ""i am already below the hotel"".  i tell her no. then she threatens me and tells me ""my boss will come to visit you at your hotel to get the money for taxi.

i started getting stressed and embarrassed. went to the hotel receptionist because i didn't know if the escort and her pimp were actually gonna show up. showed her the messages. i think she didn't understand it was an escort. she asked me if it was my friend. i told her it was not a friend and i think it's a scammer. she told me to message her ""i am i'll i can't meet you now. let's meet another time"". the escort replies with ""go to a psychiatrist you stupid idiot"".

the receptionist then tells me if i want to meet women i should go out and not call them here. i told her not to send anyone to my room if someone comes to meet me. felt so embarrassed today all due to my stupidity.

i blocked the escort and all the other escorts i tried calling today. i was dumb enough to use my real number. but luckily i have no social media and searching my number yields nothing."
pretty obvious but i have seen a lot of these replies to top comments on twitter lately 
this one made me actually nervous for a second; since the real email was hidden behind service@paypal 
ebay buyer wants me to buy a gift card to send with the package? yesterday i sold an item on ebay for $60. i received a message asking if i could buy a $300 ebay gift card because the buyer is an officer in the navy. he’s willing to pay extra for shipping and inconvenience (in addition to the amount on the card) he’s sent the money agreed upon to my paypal already. is there anyway this is a scam? i assume not since he’s already sent the money?

"got scammed $500,000hkd okay so with all the coronavirus scare going on, masks are sold out in many countries including hong kong. 

so we decided to bulk buy 2 cartons of masks from vietnam and have them sent over here. we paid 500k to this person a because he said he was able to get them for us.

but of course he scammed my family. took the money and is now mia.

is there anyway we can get the money back? now before you give rude comments, my dad knows this person... and we gave him and the whole situation the benefit of doubt. so it’s not like we just gave a random person 500k. 

tldr: sent 500k hkd to someone in vietnam to get us face masks but now he’s mia. any way of getting the money back?"
"“received a call claiming my social security number came across their desk, in the fraud department... they called me and left a robocall message. they also called my brother, looking for me. they said they were in “the fraud department “ but didn’t say the company name.

i called them back, they said they were sure it was just an oversight on my part but if i sent them money they would “drop the fraud charges.” 

has anyone else received calls like these? i know it’s a scam, and i yelled at the guy and hung up. i know how criminal charges work, i know how the courts work, this was not legit."
"i have been scammed big time okay so i was being a dumb teenager and added some random snapchat name who looked too pretty to be true. anyway, we started chatting and said she was selling nudes. i was like everyone does it so why not? (note my iq left me at this point). so i offered to buy some and gave them like $10. then after that they sent a picture of ""them"" naked and saying i should get suggestive. luckily, i didn't post anything explicit, just a suggestive caption. (it was just me shirtless with my face hidden and shirts all the way on saying something along the lines of them getting turned on). i then get a snap of my old home (uncle lives there now), and a list of relatives of mine (which they probably got off facebook). so, i freak out because they also said my full name, even though i never game them it. they said i had 10 minutes to send $400 or they would ruin my life. they honestly didn't have much of on me (because i never knew the girl pictured was underage and i never suggested that she might be and i was okay with it), but i freaked out someone knew that much about me in so little time. (the pic of my old house was from google maps, so they didn't physically go there). can anyone tell me what i should do? it's been 3 hours since the attack and i don't have the chats as it was snapchat so they would know if i saved them in some way and was scared of them. they haven't contacted me since but said they'd keep my info in case i try to fight for my money back. 

i'm a good guy, i was just being stupid and was messing with accounts i knew were probably fake. i just had no idea id ever fall for such a dumb trap. please tell me what i should do from here on."

"want to help out a fellow reddotor but afraid its a scam i commented in aita sub about a young person who was having trouble living on their own, they had just gotten out of an abusive household and we’re having to move around a lot. 

i am the president of a youth program and can make scholarships happen anywhere in the country as long as that person is apart of our program which costs $0.00. i told this redditor that if they needed food, such as canned food or any non-perishables i would try my hardest to get that to them. along with any hygiene products because that’s just as important in my opinion. i also told them about the program because i feel that getting a job is easier if you have an education in this country and also our program has a lot of genuinely nice people who will help any young person trying to get on their feet. i also feel i need to make it clear that i said, i couldn’t help finically. 

with that being said, a couple days after that post i get a private message from that redditor. they asked if i could help get them lunch that day, i messaged back as soon as i could asking how i could help get them food that day without sending them cash as i didn’t have any to give but would look into how much it would cost to send them a care package of non-perishables and hygiene products if wanted as well. they messaged back with very vague answers and also said that there were no shelters or churches in the area that gave food or had soup kitchens going on that day. i even tried to help by looking up places that they would be able to get food from. but they lived on the opposite side of the country and it was hard to tell which places where open when and what they offered. i still gave it my best shot and sent them some info. 

they then said they’re wifi wasn’t working very well and couldn’t see my messages but knew they were getting some. then i said “i can give you my phone number so you have someone to talk to through this rough time and i can still try to send you that care package but it won’t help you get food today and i’m very sorry”. they then said “i don’t have a phone” then messaged again saying “i can charge my phone if you give me your number” then messaged again before i could say anything, saying “i don’t have any service on my phone but give me your number” paraphrasing that last one as i can’t quite remember exactly what was said but it was very close to that. 

i immediately felt like something was off and haven’t responded but am feeling a bit scummy after i offered my genuine help. i don’t know what to do and feel like they were just trying to get money. 

does this sound like a scam? what should i do?"

"i had an actual discussion with someone from a robocaller call center today today i received one of my normal telemarketing calls for some free vacation in mexico. the place will either throw out the name of marriott or carnival cruse lines in the robocall portion of the call. 

well i get the guy on the phone since i'm not doing anything else at the moment and they start their sales pitch. this is what will lead to some timeshare pitch from vallarta gardens somewhere in mexico. 

so i sound like i'm interested and the guy on the phone ask me if i have any questions. i ask who they work for and he insist that he works for vallarta gardens. i then ask: why does the phone number you called me with not go back to your company. it appears to be some private citizen's phone number. the guy tells me that he's only been on the job for a 2 days but he'll grab a supervisor to explain. at this point i'm sure i'm about to get hung up on. but the supervisor comes on the phone. i ask him the same about the company they work for and the spoofed phone number. the guy admits that they do spoof numbers. but it's so their call  center doesn't get overwhelmed with people returning calls.   
i explain to the guy that they're using someone poor saps phone number to make the calls. so instead of your call center being overran with calls instead the person who's number you're using is going to get overwhelmed with calls. the guy laughs and admits that this is true. 

i then go on to ask about the 3 calls a week i get from them. and even after pressing 2, or whatever number, to remove me from their call list they continue to call. if i answer and tell them i'm not interested they continue to call. the supervisor says: well, if you just buy a vacation package we'll stop calling. i try to  give him an example: if i knock on your door and ask you for 100 bucks and you tell me no only to have me knock on your door the next day asking you for 100 bucks, would you be annoyed or would that make you give me 100 bucks. he says that he may get tired of it and eventually give me 100 bucks. i tell him that's not how businesses work and that i'm pretty sure you'd simply call the cops to have me arrested or i would be greeted with the end of a gun when you've had enough. he laughs again and tells me that i'm right. 

i explain to him that because of they way they do business i wouldn't be able to buy one of their ""vacation packages"". i also remind him that he's calling my cell phone. a cell phone that is on the do not call list. and because i've not done business with them in the past, which would give them a free call to reach out to me, they are not supposed to call my number. i wish the guy a good day and we hang up. 

i thought that it was interesting to actually have a conversation with  someone at one of these call centers vs asking something that they didn't like and having them hang up on me."

"reflecting from over a year ago, where i found a website that had all of my personal info and multiple ratings. wondering what it was. do you guys have any idea what this website is? i was pretty distressed when i found it when i googled myself. had emails, address, occupation, phone number. there was a customer service number that said to contact if you are the person in question. when i called a calm voiced female told me the page would be 404’ed. haven’t even thought about in a long time, but know i realize how creepy it was. i had 20-30 star reviews where my average was like 3 stars or something. have you guys had any similar experiences?"

"scam attempt i got this in the e-mail yesterday afternoon. i only read it now.  

xxxx one of your passphrase.   
 actually, i placed a malware on the xxx vids (sex sites) site &amp; guess what, you visited this web site to have fun. while you were viewing videos, your web browser started working as a remote desktop having a keylogger which gave me accessibility to your display and also cam. just after that, my software collected all your contacts from your messenger, social networks, and email . after that i made a double video. 1st part displays the video you were viewing, and next part shows the view of your web camera, yea its you.   
 you have got 1 solution to give me $1000. i will think of it as a donation. however, if i receive the payment, i will erase the recording immediately.   
 you will make the payment through bitcoin (search for ""how to buy bitcoin"" in google). btc address: &lt;douchebag address&gt;   
 you have one day in order to pay. if i do not get the bitcoins, i will definately send your video to all of your contacts. 

&amp;#x200b;

so, i laughed kinda hard on this one since those things are actually not true. i was a bit alarmed at first because it got my password right, but as i read through, it didn't make any sense.

so what did i do?  
1) i changed a few accounts that had same password (they weren't important sites, but anyway)  
2) i printed the e-mail on a piece of paper then pissed on it. i think my cancer cells melted it away successfully.

&amp;#x200b;

just thought i'd share this with you. thanks!"
"extremely questionable job offer, need advice context: i am in my last year of college, applying for too many jobs to count and keep track of. i get a text about a week ago from someone claiming to be the hiring manager of brp up in quebec. he wants to set up a time to interview on skype.

the weird part: it sounds too good to be true. $35/hr working from home for a fresh college grad of my credentials (not much).  the interview is not a video interview on skype, he's simply copy-pasting questions (slowly) and i'm typing responses. he also has unprofessional language/grammar (using ellipses..., not capitalizing letters, misplacing spaces eg word ?nextword).

the scam: he says a check will be sent, then i need to cash it and purchase various accounting softwares, then the company will send a laptop with the software installed to my address. i also am expected to do this as soon as i receive the check, as that is when i will ""start working.""

i expect this to be a scam 99.999%, the check will almost certainly bounce. the phone number he texted from is not the one i found on another website. i don't remember applying to this company either, so i double checked all my applications and this wasn't one of them. so somewhere my phone number is already out there due to my own sloppiness with my personal information.

the only experience i really have with scams are from playing runescape back in the day, which made me a little more sensitive to this kind of shit. i'm supposed to check back in with him at 9am tomorrow, where he'll tell me where to buy the software from the ""vendor."" should i just ignore him? block his number? change my passwords? this is my first real experience with a scammer. should i have a little fun with him before blocking him?"

"got my ass handed to me in a scam i should have seen coming a mile away. instagram scammer talk to me for about a month, then walked off with 200 bucks of mine. i'm sure this is old news for a lot of people, but i had been in contact with someone for about a month on instagram that claims to be operating a medical store out of california. went back and forth for a while, he even sent me a tiny bit of product as goodwill. then when i finally made a purchase, the scamming happened.

basically, do not believe anyone that is trying to sell you something via social media unless you have some sort of contingency plan. especially not if that person is asking for transactions via services that do not have a consumer protection like cash app.

like i said, i'm sure this is pretty obvious, but this guy was convincing. especially considering he sent me a small package before i had paid anything. wasn't pushy, wasn't trying to upsell me, was very accommodating. 

ended up spending 200 bucks, only for him to tell me that the package he wanted to send me had to have insurance on it which was another $400. i did not send the $400 because at that point i had come to my senses and realize what i had gotten myself into, but beware. 

now i'm sitting here with egg on my face broke as a joke. contacting my brother to see about pressing fraud charges, he handles that kind of stuff all the time, but it's probably not going to get me my money back. best case scenario we have a court date that's thrown out but the guy has to drive from california to meet it. really should have been smarter, now i am on the serious struggle bus and still have to find a way to pay for the medicine i was supposed to receive. i was bummed too, because the price he was offering was cheaper than going through my doctor. stupid, stupid, stupid. 

if anyone needs me i'll just be here considering my life choices.


tl;dr: even if a merchant has sent you free samples and doesn't seem to be scamming you, make sure you have a contingency plan if/when it happens. also don't use cash app for online purchases with people you don't know."

they asked me to visit the website validator.s3.org, and type in my email address. that’s when my bs meter was confirmed and i hung up. this was definitely a phishing scam of some kind, right? i assumed after they told me there was an issue they would try to lead me towards allowing remote access to my computer or something. that website looks like it’s just a tool to verify html code. are people that dumb? i’ve never really gotten a scam call before. i was shocked at how stupid it was but also how i had a 20% feeling it could be real. their persistence and confidence was a big part of that, i think. is this a common one?"

"is this website a scam?  [https://ommoney.xyz/support.php](https://ommoney.xyz/support.php) 

i saw this link was sent around a few times, and actually sometimes came from friends.

it's a website where you type in a sequence of numbers, a set of advertisements show up, and you get 10 cents in your balance.

it allows you to withdraw them only if you've reached $150, after that they set the minimum to $5.

has anyone seen this website before? is it legit? i don't want to be skeptical but it seems weird."

"still wondering if i got scammed or missed out on a good job? a long story but worth it in terms of weirdness imo.

so i was recently looking for a new job. i got a few offers and i have a full time position now, fortunately. however, i worked for 2 days at a job that was paying $20 an hour but in the end i was 95% sure the guy was setting me up for identity theft so i left. he did pay me for the 2 days i worked so sometimes i wonder if i overreacted or if i dodged a huge bullet. let me know what you think based on the situation. 

so the job was for fulfillment for an online business. i found the job on indeed, it looked really good but not a “too good to be true” type of deal. i applied and was pleasantly surprised to hear back. i did a brief phone interview and i met up with a man who did my formal interview. i met him at a local office and it seemed legit. he went over the job, basically it was an e-commerce job and i’d be running it after training. i’d be doing photography, sales and fulfillment. $20 an hour wasn’t bad at all to get back to work. i felt like i did well in the interview but didn’t know if i would get it seeing as he had stacks of resumes on the desks. he ended up calling me back and i started that monday. 

the 1st day was totally fine. the way it was going to be set up was all of the product was in an upscale storage facility that had offices attached to them. i was going to work out of the office. we moved in, what i estimate to be, close to half a million dollars worth of merchandise into this huge storage unit. we set up shelving and got to work organizing the products. the guy seemed normal and didn’t give me any red flags at all. he told me to come back the next day to finish up and then we’d start rolling. 

day 2: things start to get weird. i started to get a bad vibe from the guy and i didn’t know why. i started thinking seriously if i wanted to work so close to this person everyday but again i don’t know why he was starting to put me off. i started noticing small things that sent up red flags. for example, he had an old flip phone. he asked to use my iphone to check products. i started to wonder why in the world someone in e-commerce has a flip phone and started thinking it may be a burner phone. but why? he also would always call in response to a text message like he didn’t want a transcript. 

the products were all over the place. no rhyme or reason just products. stolen? i have no idea but i started to wonder where it all came from. i started asking more about the company and the story went from we have locations all over the us to we have 3 locations. this is our central location. “who is we? who is the owner of the company?” he tells me a generic name of the owner which of course brings a billion results in a google search. i started getting sketched out and felt like he wasn’t being open which was weird. 

then this is where i decided i was out. he tells me on the second day we need to apply for a business license and fill out my formal application since i was working out so well. so as i’m filling out my employment application he’s filling out a business application. he gives me cash and tells me to bring it to the city to apply for a license. just one problem.. it is filled out with my information only. nowhere on the business license does it have his name or the “owners” name or contact info. so i ask him why in the world am i applying for a business license. i never asked for that responsibility and it’s not my business. furthermore what kind of business puts someone they just met as the business owner. it didn’t surprise me that he was giving me so much responsibility because my background was in management but this was too much. i know the person on the business license is responsible for any fees or violations that occurred and they can rack up to hundreds or thousands very quickly. he tells me that’s why you’re here to make sure that doesn’t happen. okay... but still too much responsibility i didn’t ask for. 

so he tells me i need to be on the business license so that i can handle any situations at the location. he tells me after my training he was leaving to go to another location so i would need to be on the license not him or “richard” the owner. he had mentioned that he was leaving but now it felt weird. was he setting me up and then skipping town? he wouldn’t even put himself as an emergency contact. he asked for my parents number to put as an emergency contact. are you kidding?

so i was 99.9999% sure i wasn’t going through with this but i wasn’t sure if i was overreacting and didn’t want to throw away a job after not having one for a little while. so i said okay and took the money and started driving to the town center for a business license. i wanted to talk to them and see if this was a weird situation or if i was being paranoid. they agreed with me that it was not a good idea and that yes i’d be responsible for the operations and fees of the business. now i was 100% sure it wasn’t happening. 

i went back and gave him the money back and say i don’t feel comfortable. he was visibly pissed but just said okay i’ll put it under my name. didn’t even call “richard” to check. so we finished up the day i took my money for the last two days and i was so creeped out by the time i left. 

he did call me the next day but i didn’t go back. i basically told him through text the situation was sketchy and he never answered. it was a bummer but i tried to move on. however, i started getting paranoid. what was he trying to do? was he doing something illegal? was he trying to set up a business in my name to get loans? why did he have a burner phone? why was he avoiding association with this “business” like the plague. how much of my info did he have through indeed? he didn’t have my social luckily. i felt like it was a scam but i just didn’t know what the scam was. there had to be some legitimacy based on the fact that he had so much product. 

i ended up going to the police and they weren’t very interested. said he was probably selling illegal merchandise but didn’t care enough to follow up on it and they couldn’t do anything about my situation. i froze my credit just in case and called the city to inform them that i wanted no part in this business and to make sure he couldn’t apply for anything in my name. i followed up and they said someone did apply eventually so i don’t know if it was him or he just moved onto a new applicant. 

i still don’t understand what happened or if it was a scam. what do you think? scam or did i pass up a decent paying cushy job?"

"brand new iphone pro stolen can it be tracked or blacklisted ? hi guys , i ordered a brand new iphone 11 pro 256gb from apple.com they sent it out for next day delivery. i was at work and they supposedly dropped the iphone without a signature and left. i came home about 2hrs later and it was no where to be found. i contacted fedex who referred me to apple and then apple immediately put in for a replacement to be sent out free next day. fast forward to now 9 days later and the replacement finally showed up (again no signature required , i really find that totally crazy) 

my question is , the original iphone that went missing when and if somebody try’s to turn it on will apple be able to flag it / locate it? or only if / when someone try’s to connect it to there provider of choice they can blacklist it ? i see more and more of these thefts happening , and me reading about them and apple seeming to do nothing about it. you would think a simple signature could help prevent a lot of this. my main concern is that somebody doesn’t get to benefit from the iphone weather it be a porch pirate or a inside job with fedex. what procedures does apple take to ensure the original missing iphone will be unusable? from my reading it seems like only cell phone carriers can black list a phone , and if it’s brand new is there really no options in place for apple to stop this from happening?"

their website has names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.

they have repeatedly said my personal information is not required, and can be paid via check or direct deposit. they listed out the duties of the position, as well as companies in the area (that i googled and all came up with reviews and results.)

....then she forwarded the call to her 'manager' to help with my original issue (both had heavy indian accents)....however all he wanted to do was 'verify' the gift card info....he asked my address and when i gave my new address....he said ""no it's xxx street"" and gave me my address from 10 years ago!!!!....now i was really suspicious so i said i don't want the gift card anymore...please just take care of my issue...he wouldn't stop about the gift card so i hung up...

he immediately called me back...now i knew something was wrong and i must have originally dialed the wrong number. i hung up again and called the real boa and cancelled the card i had given them..

i am really scared now...they have my name, dob, address and card info (now cancelled) i have no idea how he knew my old address either....i reported to boa as well. how screwed am i?"
"forex scam from somalia finished its robbery many people now finally reporting that the fake forex scam did indeed run off with their money.  i've been warning numerous friends of mine and also my own relatives that there is no way in the world a $1k deposit can generate you $300+ a month via forex.  they just wouldn't believe me and kept insisting that many people are seeing returns and themselves saw returns.  i told them, exactly, that is the whole scam, take $1k or $2k or $5k from you and they'll give you back $100 or $200 for a 2 months, then run off with the rest of your money.  these people actually believed some companies will be working via their money to get them returns.  my truck driver friend of mine fell for it and when i called him to tell him i've heard the culprits have vanished with people's monies-- he changed the subject to tell me he's taking his kids to school to get me off call lol, and he never did subject changing in his life.

i've been warning these people. i'm in us and done puts calls yolo stuff in us stock markets, also gained thousands and lost thousands and know for 100% fact that there is no such thing as investing $1k or $2k or more that gets you hundreds a month in returns, i've told them it is somalia for crying out loud, a corrupt and barely developing country, please don't fall for it, but they did.

the guy who ran it in somalia was mentioned as being driven in bullet proof heavily armored car, and i'm like ""well of course he will be heavily guarded, he's running biggest multi-million dollar scam to come out of east africa"".  they need to imprison that guy for life.

it's amazing how friends from east africa were calling me and taking with tone that indeed it is actually getting returns for people.  lol."

"sextortion victim here i was recently sextorted on facebook. i have made everything private on facebook, linkedin, instagram, twitter, even going to switch up letters on my username.

i was wondering what most scenarios of sextortion play out like after these steps have been taken. i don't think i made the sextorter angry so they would have no reason to send out stuff. they showed me screenshots of a few dms with my friends but just ""hello"" and ""hi"" stuff with no context. 

tldr: should i be worried if i deactivated all my stuff after sextortion? will the sextorter release my stuff?"

"aeromexico is a scam have you ever flown with aeromexico and been fucked over by their cancellation policy that they don't tell you about beforehand?

my partner and i each purchased round-trip tickets to mérida with aeromexico. the itinerary was: montreal - cdmx, cdmx - mérida.

our first flight from montreal to cdmx left 52 minutes late because they had a false start on a runway that was not available. we arrived at the gate, which they did not tell us about until we arrived in cdmx, 20 minutes before departure time. the gate agent had a power trip and told us that we could not get on, and even tried to say that the flight was already gone. i asked her why it was already gone, since it was 20 minutes before departure time. she brushed us off and told us to go talk to customer service. this made us miss our connecting flight to mérida, and upon arriving at customer service, we found out that they've cancelled our entire round-trip itinerary.

we had to buy brand new tickets from cdmx - mérida and mérida back to montreal. we've more than tripled our trip budget, thanks to this scam. our round-trip ticket was $380 total originally, but after this bullshit, we've spent about $1000 each, just on air travel.

they didn't tell us about this scam of a cancellation policy beforehand, and told us that they will not be helping us in any way since we are a ""no-show"", and they don't care about immigration or security line-ups, as they have nothing to do with them. they never even sent us an itinerary confirmation email in the first place.

""it's the government's fault, not ours,"" they insisted, even though it was their fault that the first flight departed late, making us miss our connecting flight. they kept flashing photos of empty immigration and security line-ups from another day (or morning that day, who knows), claiming those photos were taken exactly when we arrived and that there was absolutely no line-up, so we must've wasted time chilling at security and immigration.

we stayed at the airport for 3-4 hours waiting for them to ""check"" what they can do, which we realised was just them swerving us and hoping we would give up and leave. during the 4 hours, we spoke to 2 supervisors and 3 customer service agents, who were nothing but rude, condescending, and straight-up bullying us. they screamed in my face and were even laughing, taking pleasure in our misery.

after 4 hours of losing our marbles at the airport, we finally just buy a new ticket to mérida and leave. we tried calling their customer service centre, but they also said that even though they acknowledge that there wasn't enough time to make it to the gate, they won't be doing anything about it. we had expedia call them multiple times as well, but they will not be doing anything for us apparently.

what can we even do at this point? there are countless reviews online about the exact same scenario, and i can't believe that they're getting away with shit like this. i've tried asking my credit card to initiate a chargeback, but they seem iffy about our chances since aeromexico knows exactly how to dodge this situation.

if anyone else has experienced this, tell us! maybe we can make something happen if we speak up together."
"is this considered harassment? context: i’ve been applying to multiple jobs on indeed in regards to my field. i attach my phone number as well in case they want to call for interview. i got a text from one of the jobs i applied for. 

it says “hi, this is *name* from *company name*, you just applied to the job.” 

i responded politely although it seems weird to me because it was 12:46am. i started calling him sir and he responded with “sir? i think i like that lol”, and then i knew something was off. he asked me if i’m “that young” and i said that i’m 24 years old then he started saying he’s 40 with “so not bad”. he then told me that he’s hiring quickly and if i could do an interview the next day. so i said that i can’t because i have school and work (my current job: minimum wage).

he then mentioned about coming and checking out the positions available. i responded with a thank you. he then sent me a “do you want to make fast cash? and not work too hard?” in which i did not reply.

the next day, i got another message from him asking “do you want to come see me today?” i still did not reply because i know it’s bullshit.

after two days, he sent me another message saying “$300 for one hour”. i still did not reply. i also got emails from the same guy using the company’s name inviting me for interview in which i did not respond.

""we don't need admin access!"", they say. within two to three days, most of the accounts get banned by facebook.

because of the fact that a lot of the accounts have information and pictures of the ""owner"" living in the united states, but mysteriously only have friends from india, i am assuming that this scam is based out of there. i've also recently been getting emails to the same effect to my business email address, but pretending to be bored panda (i know bored panda is real, but this is not them).

clearly, this is a scam, with the end goal certainly for me to pay them somehow. just for curiosity sake, does anyone know how this scam is supposed to play out?"

a older man infront of me was paying for gas that he supposedly didnt remember buying. he was disoriented when they told him he had to pay a sum of 50$ or else they would call police. i didnt think anything of it. i pay my 5.45$ for their name brand windshield washer and i return to my vehicle 

the same man who was i'm assuming the manager comes running out telling me i better come back inside or else. he then explains that i took gas without paying it. visually there are cameras surrounding the pumps i told him to verify the camera and call the police if he thinks i stole the gas and that he had my plates if he needed to find me. he then began to become aggressive saying the camera system is down and that i better give them 50$ cash for gas which i did not take. 

i believe these two employees working tonight are scamming customers or doing some type of fraud. i left without paying for my ""stolen gas"" which i never took but i think everyone should be aware and avoid this place at all costs!! 

_________________________________________________________
ce soir, mercredi 26 février vers 17 h 45, je me suis arrêté à la station-service @shell à chambly (1475, chemin chambly, carignan, québec j3l 0j6) je n'avais pas de lave vitre et j'en avais besoin 

un homme plus âgé devant moi payait du gaz qu'il ne se rappelait pas avoir acheté. il était désorienté quand ils lui ont dit qu'il devait payer une somme de 50 $, sinon ils appelleraient la police. je n'y ai rien pensé. je paie mon 5,45 $ pour leur lave-glace et je retourne à mon véhicule

le même homme qui était, je suppose le gerant vient en courant en me disant que je suis mieux de rentrer à l'intérieur il explique ensuite que j'ai pris du gaz sans le payer. visuellement, il y a des caméras autour des pompes. je lui ai dit de vérifier la caméra et d'appeler la police s'il pensait que j'avais volé le gaz et qu'il avait mes plaques s'il avait besoin de me trouver. il a  commencé à devenir tres agressif en disant que le système de caméra était en panne et que je suis  mieux de leur donner 50 $ en comptant pour du gaz que je n'ai pas pris.

je crois que ces deux employés qui travaillent ce soir essaye de faire une fraude. je suis parti sans payer pour mon ""essence volée"" que je n'ai jamais pris mais je pense que tout le monde devrait être au courant et éviter cet endroit à tout prix !!

"i keep getting these from ""amazon."" gotta be a scam right? "
"underage dating scam on february 23 after i got home from work at 8pm i saw i matched with someone (a girl) on okcupid. on the site it said ""she"" was 18, and she clearly looked like she was at least that if not older in ""her"" pictures. she had a nose piercing, a fully developed body (not trying to sound weird - just honest) and the way ""she"" presented herself was the way i felt like an adult women would; as far as dress, makeup, and again piercings - she looked older than 18. 
we messaged for maybe only and hour before she gave me her number. being as i am new to dating sites (i am 23 m) i thought this was normal, after all we are supposed to get to know each other right? what better way to do that than to have each others numbers. 
very soon after we started texting she sent me a picture of herself (not nude.). i can't remember exactly what i said, but i basically told her she was cute. 
before i continue i will admit i am a virgin, i am not ashamed of it and it partly has to do with the fact that i went through a religious period in my young life - high school. i say this because i think was part of the reason my judgment was irrational, the sexual side of me was looking for someone to share it with and i thought this was an opportunity to do so. lol. yes make fun of me, i know i sound stupid. it is part of who we are as human - animals - and sometimes we cannot help it.
anyway, we texted some more and flirted with each other, sexual in nature. i sent her a picture of myself with my face partly covered with my phone (not completely nude - but shirtless.). remember i thought she was an adult at this time. shortly after she sent another picture of ""herself."" not nude, but a little more revealing. i continued to flirt with her, and than she said she was actually 17, but turns 18 in less than a month, and that she graduated high school early and was in nursing school. 
than she asked me to send a nude pictures of myself - asked how big i was etc. (i was thinking that this was moving along pretty quickly. lol. yes i was naive, i think partly because i am a virgin and i was exited that a ""girl"" actually ""wanted"" to talk to me. 
i told her i didn't want to get in trouble, because she was 17. but also in my stupid head i was thinking, well she turns 18 in a month, and maybe she was exited to turn 18 so she created a dating profile in advance. i can understand, i was exited to turn 18 at time time too and i actually did graduate high school when i was 17 because i have a summer birthday. lol. i thought way she was acting was normal behavior. 
i didn't want to send her a nude, but again out of gullibility from being naive, she convinced me to and said i could trust her, she turns 18 in less than a month anyway and the age of consent in most states is 16 years old, so i didn't feel like a creepy person. plus i am still young too. it would be different if a 45 year old man did this.
so, i send a picture, not with my face in it. she flirted with me some more and it made me feel good, someone (a girl) accepts me for who i am. 
than she sent me a naked picture of ""herself."" remember all the pictures she sent me looked like an adult women, she had a belly piercing, nose piercing, ear piercings, and she just had an older look to her face. she looked like she was at most late twenties. i was suspicious. and in one of her pictures she sent me she had a different haircut. extra suspicious. i thought maybe these photos were stolen from somewhere online and someone was playing with me. but being stupid, i gave them the benefit if the doubt, because i am nice/ good by nature but have now learned that people take advantage of people with good natures.  
because of my good nature and always giving people the benefit of the doubt is also the reason i ""trusted"" her when sending her pictures (yes plural, because i sent another picture of me, but with my face partly covered again with my phone.). 
i go to bed that night feeling safe and like everything is okay. 
the next day i text ""her"" and say if ""she"" doesn't want to talk anymore that it would be okay with me and that i respect her privacy, plus i felt a little weird talking to her still. she didn't address my question when i asked her and just said ""good morning babe!"" later i would see how she would dodge other questions as well, which made me suspicious. (like what type of phone she has, what type of car she has, etc. just questions about her life that would provide more details.) 
i asked what her birthday was and she said march 20th (this is in 2020 and when i asked her this it was february 24th.) this made me feel a little better, she was basically 18, i was thinking.) 
i asked what type of work her parents did, she said father was a doctor and mom was an elementary school teacher. i asked if she was going to class today (it was a monday - school's are usually in session.) for nursing. she said no. i thought that was weird. she also said that she was helping her mom do stuff this day. i was thinking shouldn't your mom be at school teaching? she is a teacher after all and it's a monday, no holiday today. hmm. 
we stopped texting till evening came along and i was receiving a lot of phone calls from ""her"" but couldn't answer because i was driving. i called back when i got home bur she didn't answer. i was confused. also the ringtone when calling sounded really. weird, like i was calling abroad maybe? hours went by and i was texting her asking why would she call so many times and than not answer when i call (i called a few more times) , plus not answer any of my texts anymore. 
she called again, i answered. ""hello, hellooo, hello?"" no ones replies. they hang up on me. 
they call again later that night and her ""dad"" is on the phone. ""why you texting my 16 year daughter!? he asks. i told him that she said she was turning 18 march 20th, she must have lied to me. 
he told me i better start praying because he wants to send me to jail. i was sorry and apologized and told him i except full responsibility for what i did, i should know better. he said his daughter was a rape victim and was in her room crying because i was texting her. i felt really bad and apologized again, how was i suppose to know? 
he said he would call back after he talks to his wife on ""what he will do with me."" 
he called back and said if i help pay for his daughter to go to counseling he would forgive me, basically. he want $1,600 from me. 
being scared i was like, yeah sounds good to me. i was just happy he was willing for forgive me. 
as i am talking to this guy i am thinking he sounds nothing like a doctor. he kind of sounded like a person from the ghetto (no offense.). he said he wanted me to pay him through chime, vimeo, or paypal. i was thinking why would or doctor want me to pay him through these methods? i can understand paypal, but chime or vimeo? hmm. 
i asked if i could send him a check. he said no he wants his money tonight. i suspicious because he didn't want me to have his address, i assume. 
ultimately i tried to wire him money, his bank was in sioux falls south dakota. but he said he was from south carolina. okayyy. weird. 
he wouldn't give me his real name but his fake name was jesse lane. 
i continued to grow more suspicious. i researched dating scams online and found underage dating scams everywhere. i was surprised. i hung up on him and texted him back that he can go to jail for extortion, harassment, impersonating someone they are not, and having ""child porn."" the pictures were clearly not of a child though, but of an adult women, i was just playing his own game. 
i went and got a new phone and number the next day, changed all of my email addresses and deleted my okcupid account. i am never using a dating site again. i also email okcupid and they apologized and said this is a common dating scam the past few years. i also emailed my police station (to cover all bases) and they also said this is a common dating scam. i reported the mans phone number to the federal trade commission. how ever i know scammers can spoof caller id so it might not be their actually number. 
if you have any questions please ask. i know i am stupid for continue to text the ""girl"" after she was she turns 18 in a month. we are all humans and sometimes our emotions, hormones and good nature get the best of us, it did for me. 
lastly to make it clear. i did not pay him the amount he was asking for. 
thanks fir reading."
"local number calling for 800 number payday loan scam repost due to forgetting to censor numbers.

i always ignore messages from numbers i don't recognize if i don't have the availability to use google call screening when they call.

this number (local) left the following voicemail:

this message is intended for (last name, first name), ""file number #######"". this is a documented attempt to reach you regarding matters governed by the laws of your state. please call back at 8xx-xxx-xxxx.""

i accidentally deleted the voicemail before i could completely transcribe the rest, but that's the basic gist. 

so in case anyone gets this call, they're trying to scam people with (i'll own this) less than ideal credit. either you've had a payday loan before or you've shopped for one, but according to google results, they claim you owe on an unpaid loan and are (surprise surprise) willing to settle with you instead of taking you to court (claiming they're already in the process in some cases). either they scam you for money, or they get you to verify your identity with full dob and social so they have a legitimate match to use for identity theft.

ignore these calls, don't engage with anyone you happen to get connected to, and warn your family that the scammers might have gotten your information from one of those sites that compiles lists of people related to you, so they shouldn't give out information either, as it's not legitimate.

just wanted to give you guys a heads up. i get these calls at least once a year, but i don't see this scam posted as often as the google voice code or the fake check/gift card scams.

be aware!"

where i from, in the middle of french countryside, we don't usually buy things online.

 any tips on what i should look for and where? 

thanks in advance!"
"tech support scammers. what do i do? [new to reddit] might have some errors or confusing text layout? long thread so be warned. this issue of mine has been going back for the last 5 / 6 years and is still an ongoing source of irritation and stress.

it started after i got the nbn (***national broadband network***) through the telecommunications company telstra, i originally had a plan with them, 200 gigabytes of internet data a month and unlimited phone calls within the state i live in. i had heard that adsl 2 was going to be upgraded to the nbn within my area soon so i had decided to get it because i was starting to get bothered with how slow the internet was at times.

a few months later i got a phone call from some people who claimed to be from the nbn, **(i didn't know anything about the particular company that was calling me)** and thought they were affiliated with telstra because telstra outsources clients to 3rd party companies. 

the conversation went on for ages much to my frustration and sadly it got me nowhere.

they tried the following scams:

**1: decrease phone and internet bill:** 

since i'm a client of public trust i can't go giving any company my bank details. if they want to do anything that involves money they need to go to my trustee directly and arrange / rearrange bills legitimately. 

**2: add a mobile phone to ""sweeten the deal""**

i am not the biggest fan of mobile phones / smart phones. i currently have a cheap smart phone but took me 6 months to realise it wasn't working. (i still have it). that's how rarely i ever touch it. i have a strong disliking of annoying text messages or phone calls from people i don't know and have that happen at very inappropriate hours (between the hours of 6:00 pm / 8:00 am).

**3: the ""your computer sending virus and malware messages therefor we need to disconnect your internet connection"".**

i run trend micro security, the maximum security version of the program. my computer scans the network thoroughly and scans every last file thoroughly. i rarely download anything and if i were to, the internet security program would say something like ""this is a virus or is malware, do you wish to precede "" or just terminate the connection to the site or pop up. since i trust my security program i don't download harmful stuff or visit sites that potentially harbour viruses or malware of any sort.

**4: ""you have a 3rd party accessing your internet, we need to disconnect your internet""**

there's no 3rd party access to my internet, even if it were the case telstra would have notified me themselves through the mail and not over the phone, it is not their shtick unlike that of the scammer themselves. 

**5: ""your internet connection and phone will be disconnected because of 3rd party access, please talk to us to not be made victim of a crime"".** ((going on right now)) 

same deal with the 4th scam. telstra would notify me via mail and would not send threatening phone calls. their new tactic is to call me with a private number instead of using outer state phone numbers (02 &amp; 03 australian area code numbers). 

the calls are definitely targeted because it would have stopped if it wasn't.

**i need help with figuring out what to do next / now. does anyone know what i should do to make these bastards leave me alone?** any advice would be greatly appreciated. i'll keep building up on this thread if anything new happens.

&amp;#x200b;

ps: i hope this thread wasn't tl;dr material."

"job offer scam from usa for context, i am a 24 (f) asian living with my parents in the middle east (also asia). i am living on parental visa since i am not married or employed, i have been searching for a job actively online for 7 months now because i graduated. now, where i live it's impossible to get a job for expatriate children who grew up here( like me), they actively hire their citizens only(they are mostly unqualified/lacking language skills), if they hire expatriates they have to have years of experience etc. it's very tough especially for a female, they don't issue visa for them now. now my point is i never got the opportunity to work, i don't have experience besides little bit of product promotions as a college student. it's illegal for expatriate students to work, now products promotions are also banned for them, it's safe to assume i've got close zero work experience.
long story short i applied for a receptionist position, i had no idea it's from america(supposedly), i thought it's from a city near mine because it's in their location description. they said i'm a perfect candidate for them, that's the weirdest/fishiest thing i've ever heard. firstly, i don't have experience, i don't have driver's license, i am dependent on my parents. why would america want to hire me just by reading my resume and without any interview, just by contacting me via email and asking a few questions. america itself has so many unemployed, qualified youths. my gut feeling is that this is 100% a trap, perhaps human trafficking gang or something. here is their email :

""dear applicant ,

      thanks for contacting the the bellagio hotel/restaurant with
your resume .  reading through your resume (cv) . we are sure that you
will be a serious and perfect worker for the restaurant/hotel  .
before we proceed with the terms and conditions of the job , you need
to get to us with the the following information required by the management
of the restaurant / hotel

1. what is your full name ?
2. what is your nationality ?
3. do you have children ?
4. do you smoke or any drug addict ?
5. do you drink a lot of alcohol ?
6. can you  drive (car , bike , truck) ?
7. have you worked in the restaurant / hotel  before ?
8. do you have a valid passport ?
9. what is the post you are applying for ?
10. have you ever travel out to your country ?
11. what is your current occupation ?
12. have you ever been to the united states or canada before ?
13. full or part time?
14 give us your whatsaap contact number?


please be honest while answering the questions above ,

thanks and waiting""

there are spelling/grammatical mistakes in the email and bit unprofessional.

here is my response email (which is very dumb as well) but still hired me:

""dear management,
thank you for your kind response. i am absolutely thrilled to get your positive response.
following are the answers of your questions:
1- stay_survive
2-  asian country (third world country) 
3- no children (unmarried/single)

10- yes, because i am already an expatriate (living with parents, on family visa) 
11- student (pursuing ***)
12- no

the above answers are correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

"the world race not sure if this really fits in here, but a lot of what i’ve read about the world race, a christian missionary organization, seems really suspect. the world race is a missions trip where american young adults go on a mission to 12 different countries in 12 months. my research indicates that it costs roughly $12,000 total to go. a facebook friend of mine went on the world race and from what i’ve gathered, they’ll let you go on the mission trip before raising the ridiculous amount of money to pay for the trip. meanwhile, you’re expected to crowd source while you’re on the trip in order to raise enough money before certain deadlines. it seemed like a lot of people were crowdsourcing during the entire mission trip with some not even making enough money by the end of the trip. also, from my facebook friends account, it seems like they aren’t really doing any humanitarian work and are instead just doing touristy things, though that could be due to what my friend chose to post about the trip. additionally, there are several accounts spread across the internet from former participants with complaints that the world race organization is poorly planned, sometimes forces the participants to find their own housing in a county in which the organization has no connections in order to “network” for them? 

i’m not really sure why i’m so fascinated with the world race, probably for the same reasons i’m fascinated by mlms. 

any thoughts or opinions?"

"got this gem today i had to re post this because, apparently the mods needed me to remove the “personal information” of the fake name of the scammer, so here we go:


interim assistance general manager,
(operations, maintenance, airport)
hello good friend

                          your abandoned package for delivery

i have very vital information to give to you, but first i must  have your trust before i review it to you because it may cause me 
my job, so i need somebody that i can trust for me to be able to review the secret to you.

i am mr. , head of luggage/baggage storage facilities (operations, maintenance, and transportation) here at 
the harrisburg international airport, pennsylvania usa. during my recent withheld package routine check at the airport storage 
vault, i discovered an abandoned shipment from a diplomat from london and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money 
in a metal trunk box weighing approximately 110kg. the  consignment was abandoned because the contents of the consignment 
was not properly declared by the consignee as ""money"" rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also 
the inability of the diplomat to pay for the united states non inspection charges which is $3,700usd. on my assumption the 
consignment is still left in our storage house here at the  harrisburg international airport pennsylvania till date. the 
details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official documents from the united nations office 
in geneva are tagged on the trunk box.

however, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of the inspection 
unit, i will advise you provide your current phone number and full address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the 
address on the official documents including the name of nearest airport around your city. please note that this consignment is 
supposed to have been returned to the united states treasury department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding 
the clearance processes so as a result of this, i will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. so in 
order words to enable me cross check your details, i will advise you send the required details to my private email address for 
quick processing and response. once i confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, i can get everything concluded within 
48 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.

lastly, be informed that the reason i have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is 
because i want us to transact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment has not yet been 
returned to the united states treasury department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation is 
made, i will go ahead and pay for the united states non inspection fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be 
delivered to your doorstep or i can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share.
i wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and i will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential. please get 
back to me via my private email :  ( ) for further directives.

thanks,

mr."

i've read that getting someone to say ""yes"" as a scam is an urban legend but by asking me to ""say that again"" it did seem like the caller wanted to hear a verbal ""yes.""

also, i got a little bit of a red flag from their last couple of emails. there's a couple lines that talk about people disparaging them on social media and why we should ignore it. here's what it says.

""we are one of the oldest most admired and highly respected agencies representing models. ignorance and social media is a terrible thing. however common sense should assist you in making the right decisions in life. a few uninformed people trying to mislead new models offer completely incorrect opinions without merit attempting to ruin your chances for success, out of spite because her son lost out on a national magazine cover to another model""

it goes on to say that, while they don't sell anything, we need to pay $60 to a website company to maintain a profile for one year. they also want us to pay for insurance, booking insurance of some sort? sounds fishy. 

there are misspellings and poor writing. the sales pitch is too aggressive.

does anyone know anything about this modeling agency?"

"i've been scammed out of $150 on facebook marketplace i've always been skeptical of the facebook marketplace, but i've been wanting a switch lately and found a good deal for one on there. the buyer specified that they would only ship the item, which i thought was weird, but i figured i might as well ask why. they said it had something to do with them being back at college now. so the conversation continued, they sent plenty of pictures of it, and we agreed i'd pay them via cashapp once proof of shipping was providing. i realize cashapp is another red flag but i overlooked it at the time. so later i receive photos of the items on a counter next to a usps box, and a photo of the counter at a post office, and receive a tracking number. the agreed-upon price was $250, but since i had limited money in my bank account and the rest in cash i could only send $150 with a promise to send the next the rest day. a few hours go by and the tracking number hasn't shown any updates, and when the expected time of arrival comes, i don't receive anything. the next day i asked him about the tracking number, he says he ""called the clerk"" and that the package was shipped, and asks if i had been to the bank yet. i said no, and then he blocked me. i wasn't sure at first, as his post has vanished, but i realized i could still find it whilst signed out of facebook. i create a new account, find and message him, and he insists innocence and that he didn't block me, his post just got taken down. he insisted that he called the post office, and that they said it was delivered, but refused to give me the number he called, then blocked that account, too. now, i can't report his ad because he blocked me, and brand new accounts can't access the marketplace either. so, short of finding a friend to report him for me, what can i do?  


apologies for any grammatical issues, this was typed quickly."
is this a possible scam? 
i’ve encountered a scam i haven’t seen before so i was doing things on fiverr and i got a message from someone offering to give me money so they can make an account on upwork. so i decided to entertain the idea since this is my first time encountering a scammer. after a while he says he’s from china and he wants to make an account on upwork. so we start chatting on discord and i send him a grabify link and it says he’s from chicago so i ask him about it and he insists that he’s from china. finally he says he’s tired and gets off so i decide to look up what this whole thing was about and apparently the use your account and through teamviewer they scam other people and their accounts don’t get banned and they do this on a mass scale.

"female reddit user u/madisxnxo scamming, claiming to sell content of her dropbox without actually selling anything. other users have experienced same scam. the reddit user u/madisxnxo is a scammer on reddit claiming to “sell” her content. on her profile and posts she advertises the supposed “content” for her prices listed, like other users do as well. however this girl is actually scamming users into buying her content, and once the money is received she will ghost you and not respond to you. while still being active on her media where you “purchased “ her content . once the money is sent she simply stops responding, as there is no content or “dropbox”. she has done this to me and other users, which is why we have called her out on her posts, and  is the reason why she is not able to advertise  to other subreddits anymore. she is stuck posting to her followers, because no one can comment calling her out on her scams as posts to followers are comment locked. unlike on other posts which she has since deleted as we called her out on her actions.  when asked about why she stole the money she said “take the l and move on” “get a grip my dude” she said her scamming doesn’t matter because many other people in the world scam. she would then say i’m ruining her life and her income for her kids? scamming? she was trying to flip her scamming into me. she is blatantly stealing and there is no remorse and no accountability for her disgusting actions. this infuriated me as many other female users actually do sell their content, meanwhile we have a girl wanting to just scam users for their money and not be accountable on reddit. i have the screenshots if need be of her admitting to her scam and a bunch of other contradicting nonsense that she was spewing, defending her scam."

"hotel phone scam? asked to hold line open got a call claiming to be from the front desk, saying they're running a phone test tonight and it'll ring late, and the best way to prevent that was to keep the phone off the hook. he used my room number so it seemed legit enough in the moment, but i hung it up and called down to the desk after a few minutes, and they had no idea what i was talking about and said they transferred someone up to me who ""seemed like he knew"" me. mmhmm.

this sorta seems like a variation on one ring but i have no idea what the financial mechanism is because it was inbound, not outbound.

harrisburg international airport pennsylvania
one terminal drive, middle town,
pa 17057, pennsylvania usa
hello good friend

                          your abandoned package for delivery

i have very vital information to give to you, but first i must  have your trust before i review it to you because it may cause me 
my job, so i need somebody that i can trust for me to be able to review the secret to you.

i am mr. charles colocino, head of luggage/baggage storage facilities (operations, maintenance, and transportation) here at 
the harrisburg international airport, pennsylvania usa. during my recent withheld package routine check at the airport storage 
vault, i discovered an abandoned shipment from a diplomat from london and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money 
in a metal trunk box weighing approximately 110kg. the  consignment was abandoned because the contents of the consignment 
was not properly declared by the consignee as ""money"" rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also 
the inability of the diplomat to pay for the united states non inspection charges which is $3,700usd. on my assumption the 
consignment is still left in our storage house here at the  harrisburg international airport pennsylvania till date. the 
details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official documents from the united nations office 
in geneva are tagged on the trunk box.

however, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of the inspection 
unit, i will advise you provide your current phone number and full address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the 
address on the official documents including the name of nearest airport around your city. please note that this consignment is 
supposed to have been returned to the united states treasury department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding 
the clearance processes so as a result of this, i will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. so in 
order words to enable me cross check your details, i will advise you send the required details to my private email address for 
quick processing and response. once i confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, i can get everything concluded within 
48 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.

lastly, be informed that the reason i have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is 
because i want us to transact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment has not yet been 
returned to the united states treasury department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation is 
made, i will go ahead and pay for the united states non inspection fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be 
delivered to your doorstep or i can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share.
i wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and i will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential. please get 
back to me via my private email :  ( mr.charlescolocino@citromail.hu ) for further directives.

thanks,

mr. charles colocino"

"is this a scam? please help? okay so i applied to this private practice dental office, they were hiring front desk no experience. i was like oh this is great! so i apply, (on indeed only) and i call them to inquire about it, they have me come in for an interview (yesterday) and i met with a dental hygienist for the interview. she told me we just do a lot of cold calling patients to have them come back in, normal dental front office work (checking patients in, scheduling, ect) and then she mentioned if i was okay to go to florida for training, keep in mind i’m in california.. and this is not a dental chain, it’s a small dental office with only one location. i thought that was odd but i just brushed it off and i went in today for a work interview. i came in, they placed me in front of a video it was playing some guy in a nice suit talking about marketing strategies, how to get patients in, words you can and can’t say, and telling me to let the patient on the phone have no control. i don’t know anything about dental front office so i thought this was okay. then i was told later on that the “training” in florida is seminars that are a few days long and mandatory. oh and this place has 40, 5 star reviews on google but 2 stars out of hundreds of reviews on yelp, they scam patients from what i’m reading. out of thousands of dollars and this isn’t just one person.. it’s the whole yelp page saying this ... i have no idea what kind of practice this is. does any of this sound normal? it was all very unorganized and no one knows what to do there. please if anyone has any idea let me know"

&amp;#x200b;

reading through homeadvisor's reviews, it seems very clear and common that homeadvisor are just scammers and credit card thieves trying to get a hold of your financial information to make fraudulent charges. notice how all those scam websites are impersonating as local contractors don't even have a phone number, but just a generic contact form for their victims to fill out, and all have the same design and layout. they are copy-and-paste fake websites meant to steal and sell your information. never provide any information to homeadvisor or those 26 fake websites. especially, never give your social security number or credit card information to homeadvisor. a legitimate contractor's website would have a phone number, most likely a direct local area code phone number (avoid any phishing websites that have a generic 1-800 or 1-855 or 1-833 phone number), other contact information such as an address or an email address, and a license number. don't fall for these 26 fake websites pretending to be contractors. when you see websites like these scam websites run by homeadvisor that only have a contact form, those are typical phishing scams and you should run and report them to the bbb and your attorney general's office. homeadvisor is using horribly treacherous fraudulent practices and false advertising. again, if you've been tricked by these fake websites or fake ads (or fake craigslist listings) that homeadvisor is running, run far away from homeadvisor and report them to the bbb and your attorney general's office.

tyler horvath of overland park, kansas and kansas city, missouri is in charge of running these scam websites for homeadvisor. his full name is tyler benjamin horvath, he was born on june 3, 1986, and he is a serial scammer. he lives in overland park, ks, which is just 1 minute away from the homeadvisor office in lenexa, ks. these fake websites are registered through namecheap and hosted by leaseweb, which is very fitting because namecheap, owned by richard kirkendall, and leaseweb are precisely the register and hosting provider typically used by hackers, scammers, and various other cybercriminals. not surprising that namecheap and leaseweb consistently refuse to help take down scammers, malware websites, and fake websites. even the majority of employees/contractors at namecheap are russian criminals - just contact namecheap support and you'll find they all have typical russian names likes valeri, dimitri, anton, natasha, oleg, etc, even though richard kirkendall, the ceo of namecheap, claims he ""has no russian employees.""

&amp;#x200b;

homeadvisor is nothing more than false advertising. as this lawsuit filed and won by the people of the state of california v homeadvisor shows ([https://sfdistrictattorney.org/sites/default/files/homeadvisor%20et%20al%20complaint\_0.pdf](https://sfdistrictattorney.org/sites/default/files/homeadvisor%20et%20al%20complaint_0.pdf)), homeadvisor is lying about contractors on its platform being background checked. i know from my insider experience that homeadvisor for a fact does not background check their contractors. the judge issued an injunction banning homeadvisor from making any further claims about background-checking its contractors. besides fake websites impersonating as local contractors and making false claims about background-checking contractors, homeadvisor engages in lots of other false advertising. homeadvisor has false ads on craigslist ([https://www.abc15.com/news/let-joe-know/are-craigslist-ads-really-from-homeadvisor](https://www.abc15.com/news/let-joe-know/are-craigslist-ads-really-from-homeadvisor)). once a contractor signs up with homeadvisor, homeadvisor hijacks that small business's online branding (as indicated on pages 136-139 of ), which is probably why only the worst contractors and construction companies out there are the kind that would ever sign up with homeadvisor. the overwhelming majority of contractors listed on homeadvisor, which i also know from extensive experience and research, do not have a license, are not registered, are not insured, but most homeadvisor contractors do have criminal records. from my own experience reviewing a few hundred contractor profiles listed on homeadvisor, well over 80% of the contractors on homeadvisor aren't licensed and many if not most have criminal records. on google or bing, by comparison, that number is probably between 5 to 10%. simply, use common sense. homeadvisor is a middleman, a giant marketing corporation, a scam, nothing more. homeadvisor is a platform for the lowest quality contractors out there, usually guys with little or no experience, guys with meth teeth or guys that haven't showered in days operating out of some van or truck, some home burglars and crooks using the platform to find their next victims, and as so many reviews of homeadvisor state: homeadvisor is for the ""bottom of the barrel"" and ""bottom feeder"" type of contractors - i.e., the worst of the worst contractors in your area. homeadvisor claims to be free, but is not and charges approximately on average 10 contractors $60 each for every 1 lead ($600 per every lead) plus the $300+ annual membership fee. homeadvisor claims they sell each lead (a homeowner's information) to only 3 contractors, but from countless bad reviews, complaints, and even undercover investigations by, for example, law firms, we know that to be false too and they actually sell each lead to as many as 10 even 50 contractors. homeadvisor's advertising slogan is ""don't overpay,"" but the very lead generation model means you'll pay extra for going through such a middleman. homeadvisor is also known to not only sell your information as a middleman to contractors who you should've gone directly to, but also to telemarketers. many bad reviews from homeowners that fell for homeadvisor complain of suddenly being on telemarketing lists for various scams. homeadvisor are well-known and documented to write fake reviews, including countless fake positive reviews of their own company, homeadvisor. homeadvisor has also been exposed generating fake leads and/or recycling old leads several times by homeowners and undercover detectives. also, once homeadvisor has your credit card information, they'll drain your bank accounts with countless fraudulent mini charges in the hopes you won't notice those charges and you'll have to then close the card or spend a lot of time disputing the charges with the bank.

&amp;#x200b;

homeadvisor has thousands of telemarketers working for them and each of those telemarketers makes, by there own admission, 200 calls a day so that is literally about 600,000 people in this country every day that are getting harassed by cold calls from these telemarketing and robocalling scammers at homeadvisor. if homeadvisor were shut down, that is 600,000 telemarketing calls that would be eliminated every day.homeadvisor bombards cable television with fancy commercials full of lies, they bombard your phones with telemarketing calls, and they bombard the internet with fake advertisements and fake websites. homeadvisor is a major scam effecting people all over the country right now like those irs scam calls. also while on the topic, avoid using any of these lead generation middlemen companies like meetmattservices, thumbtack, porch, homeadvisor, etc. that's all they are, they are just middleman giant marketing corporations that take a huge cut for adding absolutely no value and that huge cut eventually gets passed down to the customers. don't ever do business with homeadvisor in any way and don't fall for their marketing and television commercials. homeadvisor is by far the worst place on the entire internet you can go to to find a contractor as the overwhelming majority of contractors or pretend contractors that homeadvisor has signed up on its platform are not licensed, not registered, not insured, and most of the contractors on homeadvisor even have criminal records. simply never ever provide any information to homeadvisor and practice common sense when searching for a contractor.

&amp;#x200b;

homeadvisor is paying a lot of dirty money to keep getting away with this, including to eric schmidt, the ceo of google, and richard kirkendall, the ceo of namecheap. it's a lot of corruption that allows these scammers to carry on. they say to try mailing brandon ridenour, the ceo of homeadvisor, at 211 s cherry st, denver, co 80246. no response. they say to try calling and mailing matt zurcher, the senior vice president at homeadvisor, at (303) 694-4472, (303) 841-2818, (303) 282-7317 and 6661 n village rd, parker, co 80134. no response. they say to try mailing barry diller, the chairman of iac and homeadvisor, at 1940 coldwater canyon dr, beverly hills, ca 90210. no response. they say to try calling and mailing tyler horvath, the owner of projectquote llc, at (913) 961-8446 and 6005 w 128th st, overland park, ks 66209, 5601 w 136th terrace #105, overland park, ks 66224, and 14317 manor ct, overland park, ks 66224. no response. brandon ridenour of denver, co, the ceo of homeadvisor; matt zurcher, the senior vice president at homeadvisor; barry diller, the chairman of iac and homeadvisor; tyler horvath of overland park, kansas, the owner of projectquote llc; all the other executives at homeadvisor; and along all the other people who work or have worked at homeadvisor should all be locked up in prison for the rest of their lives for running these mega scams. now every time somebody comes across and googles these fake websites, homeadvisor's and tyler horvath's names will be shown and people will know the truth. homeadvisor is totally dishonest and deceitful and is nothing more than a despicable scam. due diligence, people. don't mindlessly fill-out a form you found on the internet, don't do any sort of business with homeadvisor, and practice common sense. it's time for many more class action lawsuits ([https://chimicles.com/class-action-filed-homeadvisor-iacinteractive/](https://chimicles.com/class-action-filed-homeadvisor-iacinteractive/)) against homeadvisor and lets rip homeadvisor to shreds. confiscate all the money that homeadvisor has and setup a victim compensation fund for all the small businesses and others that they've defrauded.

"youngmila bank scam and/or snapchat scam unfortunately ive been scammed and i learned my lesson. i hope anyone who thinks about doing this with “youngmila” (instagram) or “yamilaa_milaa” (snapchat) or anyone for that matter think twice about it. i know it may seem like quick and easy money especially for a young person or anyone who needs it and wants the money quick, but its best to avoid it longterm. she got me with the bank scam she was running a couple months ago on her ig, she posts pictures and stories about it claiming she can deposit money into your bank account next day. apparently she works with her uncle or something but you never know who or what shes working with. she just recently uploaded a pic on her snapchat similarly to what she posts on her ig, which she hasnt lately because shes tryna lay low, either way please be wary and think twice before getting into something like that with anyone, she’ll definitely scam the hell outta you.

"is this a scam? my girlfriend went to a car dealership and it was a massive dealership with tons of cars so it seemed like a legit place but after picking a car and everything, the employees said there is an extra $2000 fee because they upgrade all these things inside the car (and apparently do it to every car). but don’t factor that into the pricing of any of their cars. this seems illegal/false advertisement... they eventually offered to cut the $2000 in half and do $1000 but they had an advertised price and weren’t willing to honor that.

it seems like they do this to tons of people and will negotiate on a price and make it sound good then just add 2 grand to make it more worth their time or something. is this a scam or even legal?"

"i, as well as various other members in my family, have been getting at least 3-10 phonecalls per day for about a year, asking for my grandpa i decided was sick of it today, so i tried interrogating the latest scam call, using multiple tactics and approaches on how tf they got his info, and why they keep calling. they hung up. i called a ton of the phone numbers that were flagged as scams. all of them either had the exact same ""this number is not in service"" recorded message, or actually answered, asked for my grandpa, and hung up when i asked them what's going on.

it has gotten ridiculous.  put myself on the national do not call list about three months ago. the calls died down, but shot back up, and that's when i checked to see if i was on it. i got really frustrated when i found out i've been on it since around 2014.

some say to mess with them, but it's not even fun anymore. 

they all say they represent a different company, branch of the government, security, etc. but they all start with the same ""can i talk to x""? x being my grandpa. not my grandma, or anyone else who is related, or shares a household in any way.

someone told me that they can see who has lived with them since my family did in fact live with my grandparent's for a while, and because of this, we used that address to fill stuff out.

my grandpa was victim to one of those internet pop ups where they say ""your device has malware, call this number."" but he didn't give them anything other than his name, and maybe his wife's name. i don't remember if he gave them access to his laptop or not. keep in mind that he is, for the most part, relatively adept to technology. so that was a fluke for him. like he is an mri technician.

anyways, blocking doesn't work anymore. they just call, and call, and call. i ask for answers, and they hang up.

any advice?"
"snap scam maybe so just recently a friend of mine posted on their story and was asking to use someone's snapchat for 2 minutes and was gonna pay $300 i didnt think anything of it at first but then i said that they cam use mine and they were real quick to respond with cashapp and login

"scamming the ""shell game"" scammers so i went to nola yesterday for mardi gras and there was a plethora of shell game and 3 card monte scammers out on the streets.

if you don't know what the shell game is, it's basically some guy that has you bet money, hides a ball underneath a cap, shuffles it, and makes you guess which cap the ball is under.

it seems very easy, but these are impossible to win, because the game host will use illusion and hide the ball underneath the cap so that way you'll lose every time. they'll even have actors with them playing as participants and ""win"" every time to lure in spectators.

i figured that i would take advantage of these con artists and walk away with some extra cash. how did i do it? well, usually these scammers will let the player win the first round to entice them to bet more money the next round and lose.

so i went walked up them and acted like i was skeptical for a couple minutes before i told them i would only bet $20. i only did $20 because i didn't want to risk them getting me in the first round. i told them it looks too easy and that i would bet $100 next round if i win. of course they're going to want me to win that first round of $20 so that way they can get me for $100 on the second.

so i end up winning the $20 bet, then just straight up walked away. i used this strategy to about 3 or 4 of these scammers and ended up walking away with $60 or so. one guy got super pissed at me and tried to get up in my face and threaten me. told him to just fuck off as i knew he wouldn't do shit around a massive crowd of people. you won't be able to do this many times as these scammers usually work in groups and communicate on who's pulling what i did.

also one other thing, definitely do not try this if you're not surrounded by a big group on people. these will be probably try to hurt you if they're also scamming you. good luck and be safe!"

"money scam in my google calendar for some reason, i have an appointment every day in my calendar from now on as ""уважаемый получатель! - для вас зачислен денежный ""

which translates to "" dear recipient! - money is credited for you""

the full text is as follows, for anyone who is going to search for it later on:

 description:статус перевода ➡ ждет выплаты сумма доступна вам в полном объёме для получения в течение 24 часов на сайте (web site address) важно! после завершения срока получения, деньги будут отосланы отправителю, как невостребованные. ✉✉✉✉✉✉ 

it also lists a gmail address i've never heard of. it's apparently some kind of invite.

how do i proceed with this? how can i best delete these messages and give as little information as i can to the scammer?"

"roku scam i dont know how to flair this but this happened to a friend of mine. i had a roku and my friend thought it be a good idea to get one and i go over and help her set it up. when it’s time for her to go to the website and put in a code she googles it instead of typing the web address in. it says she’s got to call a number. i thought it was weird and told her. well she ended up paying $100 for a lifetime membership. i kept telling her it doesn’t seem right it should be free.

here’s what i found out, if you google the roku site to put in the code and click on the wrong link it’ll have you call a number and your out $100. if you type in the address as shown on the screen it’ll work the way it’s supposed to."

"massage appointment created in friends name with phone number attached my friend just got a phone call from massage envy in las vegas confirming his couples massage appointment and saying if he doesn't show up he will be charged a fee. we live in colorado for reference. 

he called them and found out that the appointment was booked by someone named 'susie archer' and no credit card was on file. he has no relation to anyone with that name, but massage envy had his full name and phone number.

i can't figure out what the scam would be in this case since they didn't have his credit card info. how did they get his full name and phone number though?  what would the motive be?

thanks in advance!"

"ezbucks.co i have been seeing an influx of facebook posts sharing this site that claims you can make money through social media. i googled extensively, but couldn't find any proof it was legit or a scam. so i decide to join myself, what could it hurt? well i was killing it ""made"" 1500 in a day, but here the weird part i have been having issues with the site and the only contact info is an instagram page with 3 posts and a direct email send on the homepage that doesn't seem to work. now i am starting to majorly lean to it being a time wasting scam. i still couldn't find anything on google except a blog run by the site claiming it not to be a scam, but who would trust that. i decided to come to the experts here on reddit to see what you guys could dig up. i am eager to know if there is any truth to site or everyone is just wasting time"

btw i reported it after an hour and a half since making a report on facebook is difficult.

so, i made a new account for facebook so i can try it out. without any experiences whatsoever, i didn't know what to do but ""possibly"", i managed to to make one. i used my number.

after awhile, i was messaged by someone that i ""stole"" their account and will report it as identity theft if i don't delete it.

the funny thing was it that i can't login due to the fact i failed several times. i apologized to her and asked how to delete. she said to give me my password to her so she can delete it. i did not give it to her.

she also said that she had my ""card holder"" which surprisingly, i don't have one! 

so, i deleted the application itself and told her that i deleted it even though i didn't.

it felt a little suspicious considering she has my card holder even though i don't have one. 

thanks for reading!"
"paypal phishing scam - am i screwed? my mom received an e-mail from „service@intl.paypal.com“ urging her to verify her account because it apparently was restricted due to suspicious activity (translating from german). she asked me to do it for her, i was pretty tired and didn‘t notice it was a scam.

the mail directed to a page that looks very authentically like paypal. i had to login, enter our address and my mobile number. if i remember correctly, that was the only things i‘ve entered. when we were asked for credit card information, i got suspicious, realized it was a scam and closed the website without typing in any sort of creditcard info.

i changed her account‘s password pretty quick and set up two security questions, deleted browser history and deleted the e-mail after reporting it. i‘m pretty sure i didn‘t type in any sort of bank information either. 


are we screwed regardless? if yes, what is the worst that could happen? is there anything else i need to do now to prevent something? do i have to worry about our address and my phone number, or is the worst that could happen advertising and spam calls?"
"am i being overly skeptical? hi everyone. i’m in the process of looking for a new job. i’m currently a manager at a hotel but due to the constant stress and work-life balance, i am in the process of resigning. 

i applied to this local marketing firm. their website details that they are a b2c marketing firm. when i went for the initial interview, they outlined the company. they sell products face-to-face at wholesale stores (costco, sam’s club, etc.) they seemed to be very transparent with what they sell (directv, phone plans, among other things) and they were upfront with the pay structure ($13 an hour base pay with commissions mixed in). there were 2 more rounds of interviews where i met the staff and took a tour of the office. at the end of the final interview, they gave me an offer. i told them i needed time to think on it and i will get back to them. 

does this seem like a scam to anyone else? i’ve always been wary of pyramid/mlm schemes so just hearing the term “marketing firm” gives me a bad vibe. should i take the position or continue to look?"
"possible phone scam so first time posting here so hopefully its right place.  

at my work, over the past few days, we’ve gotten the same call from an “employee” at discover.  

first red flag was a saturday call around closing time.  

on the phone dude sounds good, sounds legit, asking the right questions.  first off, he says, we’ve noticed you havnt had a process with us in quite a while (which was false). so what he wanted to do, was for us to run one of their numbers over the phone thru our terminal for $1, and we were expected to see a decline message. 

i told him no we were closing up call back next week.  
so we tell our accounts payable about this guy and she just said it sounds fake just don’t answer.  it’s always same number, and when we call back the number it brings us to a type of discover phone directory page, to enter the persons extension,etc. 

so we just started using random extensions and got a few.  the names for those extensions were basically “user #’s” with no names. 

so my main question.  what was the end game here.  for us to use the cc he gave us as a way to get a back door access to our terminal and/or credit card information?   

we forwarded this info along to our higher ups as well. 
thanks for any info in advance."

"job offer scam: mahl proofreader i recently was offered a job that i now have come to believe was a scam from people trying to gain my personal information.

i was offered a remote position as a proofreader (not strange since a lot of these are offered remote nowadays) supposedly for mahl company. while this company is legit, the people who contacted me definitely were not.

the first red flag was that they didn’t want to do a telephone interview with me. then i realized the “hr manager” i was communicating with had a very non-professional email with the name  “kat eyes” which wasn’t even close to the name they gave me.

seeing as the company is german-based, i didn’t think too much about this persons english being a bit off, it wasn’t actually too bad, but it seemed the longer we communicated the worse it got. now that i’m thinking about it, when i started asking specific questions about the job position over hangouts, they seemed to get impatient, wanting to get on with the “interview.”

they also started rushing me to accept the position and send them information. it wasn’t even a full 24 hours between the time they first contacted me and offered me a job (with a pretty handsome salary, too, how enticing). they wanted me to enclose my ssn in a normal email, which is never standard business practice. they said that the offer would expire if i didn’t sign everything and send the material before day’s end.

when i had gotten to the point where there were enough red flags for me to duck out, i told the supposed hr manager “i’m sorry i’m going to have to decline the job offer for this position.” the response?

“alright bye” - super professional 

this was obviously a terrible scam to get someones personal information, so if you see a remote job from mahl, be vary wary. if it’s someone refusing a telephone interview and they don’t have a corporate email, stop talking to them."

i keep telling them that it’s not worth it, especially because they recently became adults and can be charged more seriously, but now am not sure if they will get caught at all.
btw, they each bought around $500 worth of stuff, not sure if that matters.
i can’t find any info about this on the internet specifically, and it would be great if anyone has a source that i can read. especially because other kids have noticed and want to try it for themselves and they might face repercussions.

"victim of payment scam last night, would appreciate any thoughts dear friends,

a friend of mine was a victim of payment scam last night. we would truly appreciate any thoughts and suggestions on what best to do next if anyone shares similar experience before. 

my friend is based in seattle. last night, he was looking for someone to exchange currency (usd to rmb). he made a post in a local online group and a scammer added him. the scammer sent over a fake passport to increase credibility and promised to send him rmb once the usd is received. so my friend sent over usd using chase quickpay to the scammer's account. then the scammer ghosted him afterwards. he immediately called chase (within 1 hour of this occurrence) but was told that quickpay is instantaneous and the transaction can't be reversed once delivered. chase did filed a investigation for him but it would take 10 days to hear back.

there are many things my friend could have done better to avoid this scam. he could have asked people he knew well instead of a local group for currency exchange. and he could have asked for face to face exchange. sadly, it is too late to see this in hindsight. giving the circumstance, he would really appreciate any thoughts and suggestions. thanks a lot!"

"""underage"" scammer is calling my work hey, all. i'm sure everybody knows the old ""underage"" scamming procedure, so i won't waste all your time with the details. i'll leave a few points just so we're on the same page.

match with girl on pof. she's 19, i just recently turned 26. still kinda ehh, but i figured if she had a mature personality, i might as well try at least one date.

start talking on a friday, she sends nudes on a saturday, i say okay, send some back. i notice some incongruousness with the furniture in the background, so i start thinking she's just catfishing me.

through sat. and sun. i keep asking her to send me selfies of her ""cute face."" i'm trying to catch her in the lie and she keeps sending pictures that have obviously been taken at different times. i hold back on accusing her because there is a slight chance that i could be wrong and i don't want to be mean. we plan for a date the following friday, so i figure i don't have too long to find out the truth. i also ask her for her snapchat (because then she'd have to send photos that are current), and she says she'll do it tomorrow.

monday comes and she doesn't say anything. 

then tuesday hits and i get the fabled, ""i'm a private investigator and a friend of her family. she's sixteen and you traded nudes with a minor, call me so i don't have to go to the police, etc."" i pretty much immediately know that it's a scam, because of all the convenient activities with ""her"" photos and the incongruous backgrounds. plus, if it was real, i don't think that things would be handled this way, and the police would've been notified right away, if at all. i immediately block the ""pi"" as well as the ""girl"" i'm texting without saying anything to either. i delete her pictures just on the off chance that this person really did send me underage photos, regardless of whether they're real or not. i become a bit nervous, but not too much, because i know that i ultimately didn't do anything wrong, and if on the slight chance that this was real, it was the girl that lied to me that did the illegal activity.

*important part* but, two weeks have passed now and i thought i was done with the whole situation. i hadn't gotten any contact from anyone since blocking them. that was until today, of course, when the supposed ""pi"" called my work and directly told my boss that he had extremely important business with me and ""i would know why he's calling."" i was at lunch at the time so i couldn't answer, but i got a note with his number and it was the same name and number from the text two weeks ago. i just got home and searched his number on white pages and it came up as a skype or google number from nc, while ""the girl"" and i are from nv. 

 i think this is obviously a persistent scammer, but i'm worried it will start bringing real world complications or consequences if he begins saying untrue and unsavory things about me to my boss. i'm planning on telling her to block his number, and i'm guessing that's all i can really do about the matter. does anyone have any other advice for me other than that?"

"i am looking for an apartment through craigslist ( prob a bad idea). i have found one that is cheap and really nice. i live in new york and the apartment is in the bronx. is this a scam? so i emailed the seller and he got back to me with this [email](https://imgur.com/a/egfzjbf). sorry for the sloppy writing, but he states the address if i look it up its real, he sent picture attachments and they look the same as the apartment i looked up, he gave his full name and phone number which is a 917 number and i know most scammers wont use that, that often. 

i haven’t replied yet, but if this is real its a steal. my next email would probably just give my first name and ask to see the apartment with my brother before anything else. if he says no to that i will just move on, but i just wanted to know if its a scam. thanks!"

"recourse for craigslist scammer  not sure this is the best sub for this, but is at least a start.

i recently was stupid and sent money via zelle to someone on craigslist for concert tickets; as soon as i sent the money the person stopped responding completely and in hindsight was clearly a scam. this person is still listing on craigslist and likely taking other victims.

they were using the craigslist anonymous email, but they have their zelle account linked to a [gmail.com](https://gmail.com/) email account. i figure there should be something i can do with this information. i can't believe zelle doesn't have a way to track fraud / scam transactions as the user has to link their email account with a bank, but this doesn't seem to exist.

any ideas on what i can do here? not looking to do anything malicious, just want to get maybe more information about the person to be able to report them, etc."

 i'm like ""ok, this is scammy"", but then he states how he gets scammed by sugar babies all the time. his excuse was that he sends the money and then the sugar babies ends up blocking him after that. he just says this was his only test and he can't accept anything else. i tried other things on how he can trust me like meeting up and such, but he kept saying no. i kept telling him i was uncomfortable about this situation and is there another way you can trust me? or if i can just maybe know him more, maybe i'll do it, but then he sends ""if you're going to do it, why even bother worry about it when you can just do it now?""

i'm like ""ok... sucks that you got scammed"" and tried to block him on my fake number, but the app doesn't block the calls when he tried to call me one day. i've blocked numerous scammers before and i've never heard from them again. i'm just thinking why is he trying to chase me when he could've moved on? is this some psychological game he's trying to play to look like he cares about me?

i'm pretty sure this is 99% scam, but a part of my brain is saying no...(i hate this feeling) so i just need to reassurance to block this guy for good. i'm tired of wasting my time with scammers by giving all this attention to them only ending up to block them."

"etsy scam - expensive ""handmade"" item actually cheap from amazon my wife and i found a ""one of a kind handmade"" quilt for \~$300.00 on etsy that we really liked and placed an order for it on feb 7th. after a week, we still had no shipping information so my wife opened a case through etsy. the seller contacted us saying she was from denmark and had to ship the quilt to her friend in the states who would then ship it to us, and if we could close the ticket so she did not get ding'd by etsy. we refused saying we needed a tracking number because it seemed fishy. 

we just received the quilt today after almost two weeks, however came in an amazon package with an amazon delivery slip. the order was placed on 2/21. i was able to find the item. the same quilt is actually mass produced and on amazon, and is a third of the price vs what we paid to the etsy seller. so the seller on etsy is posting amazon products with massive markup's calling them ""handmade"" work.

the kicker is that etsy auto-closes cases when a delivery is completed. so although we caught that it was not a one of a kind and just from amazon, it was too late. etsy has no customer service line and it has proven difficult to contact anyone about this.

obviously we are upset. has anyone seen this type of scam before? is what the etsy seller did illegal? i have already reported this to both my credit card company to dispute the charge, as well as notified amazon that the person tied to the order is doing this.

my guess is that the seller was never planning on sending us anything, hoping we would close the case. then they would keep the $300. since we refused they took the hit to buy it off amazon at $100 and walked away with an easy $200 at the end of the day."
ebay scam i list items on ebay often and the last item i listed was a pair of jordan shoes. the next day i received an offer of $80.00 i  accepted i reply let me have the shipping address and i will ship once payment has posted on my paypal. he replies back asking me to text him so i do and he said he wants them shipped to his brother's address in pa then he said he will add an addition $50.00 and if i can kindly get $200.00 worth of xbox cards and include them he would pay the addition $200.00 i then inform him that no pay only the $80.00 plus shipping and i only accept paypal. i will not go and buy $200.00 wor5th of xbox cards as that is not part of the deal. sadly i have not heard from him my advice to any scammer is do not even try to scam me you will not succeed. and pray that i never find out who yo9u are or where you are located.

"is this a small business or a scam? scam or no?

tl;dr at the bottom. 

a few weeks ago, i got an email from a company that i had applied for (although i couldn’t identify which company because it was craigslist and the ad was already down) saying that i wasn’t selected for their company, but that they sent my resume off to a business contact. they gave me the contact email of this person, told me to email them for an office job, something i’m qualified for, so i thought “what the hell, why not.”

so i did, and i got a response with a long list of interview-type questions, which i answered in detail. a few days later, got the job.

so here’s how my first two weeks have been; right off, was informed that they were moving locations from one state to another (my metropolitan area) and was told to put together an expense report for equipping the new office for a small staff, with a four day timeline. being an overachiever (and really excited about this job, first time doing something in my degree field) so it was done in two days. boss was impressed, but busy, and had nothing else for me to do remotely. so i was on standby for the rest of last week, and the first part of this week.

today i receive an email from my boss, saying that he has upsed me a check for an unreasonably high amount. he said i was to keep part as a sign on bonus, and keep some to purchase office equipment. and that he would have other instructions after i sent a “deposit copy” (i don’t know what that is, neither does google, in terms of a check)

i was already on the fence about this job anyway. one of those “too good to be true” kinds of things, plus i’m pretty skeptical in general. i’ve been doing research into the person and the company, cross checking all the info i can find. and it all seems legit. like this person is a real person, this business is a real business, the phone number is from the area of the business. i’ve even tried to reach out to the company through their website, but no response yet.

something interesting to point out is that this is an upper scale type of job, they work in electrical engineering, and are making a name for themselves in the market. when i was creating the expense report, through coincidence, found out from a business contact that someone else in the area had contacted them for the exact same job, down to the budget and staff expectation. same company, all the same information. this raised some flags for me but (very hopeful me) i figured they might have a few people they like for the job, and that the expense report was a test or something. 

i want to stress that they have no information that could be of any use to them, maybe my name and address, but not my birthday or ssn. when asked if i wanted to be paid by check or by direct deposit, i said “i can forward a direct deposit form from my bank to your hr department.” it never went any further. 

i’ve shown the emails to all of my family, including my so and everyone understands and shares my concern that it might be a scam, but there are no obvious plot holes. we have even double checked things like the age of the domain name, and the service they use for their emails.

it’s a small, one-of company, with no public point of contact other than a submission form so they can reach out at their convenience. and no luck there.

when (and if) i get the check, i’m going to investigate it. don’t worry, i don’t want to commit felony check fraud.

if i can answer any questions, i will. i just want to know what the big brains of reddit think of this.


tl;dr might’ve gotten a great job, or could be a scam, but i have no way of really verifying, and now they’re sending a check. i know what not to do, so i don’t think i’m in danger, but i’d like some opinions."

"host on booking.com claiming we damaged something we didn’t as stated in the title, the host of the house i was with 5 friends for two nights in madrid is claiming we broke a marble table and charging us 250€ for it(she actually told me 200€ through imessage but after the booking contacted it was up 50€). we saw it was broken when we got there and told that to the lady that opened the house for us, not the host, probably just a maid, but because we had so little time in the city we rushed and forgot to take pictures. 

the thing is, in terms of cleaning and even basic care for the guests, the house lacked some basics. the blinks were broken, one of the bathroom sinks was flooded, one of the guest had a inflatable mattress as an extra bed, and the other had an awfully dirty couch also as an extra bed. we told some of these to the host but some we only found out late at night, for example, there were one set of towels and sheets missing for one of the guests, a dirty towel thrown in one of the beds, for example. 

we were extremely careful with every single thing in the house and left the house even cleaner than we found it as we didn’t want to pay the 50€ damage fee she had written in a paper exactly in the marble table mentioned. 

i’ve told all this to the booking assistant but i’m really afraid they’re just going to take the side of the host. anyone has experienced this?"

"my bf was a victim of sextortion here in reddit. hey, this is my first ever reddit post so please go easy on me... let's begin...

ok, me (f24) and my partner (m28) have been in an ldr for almost two years now and are planning to get married soon.

he lives somewhere in na and i live somewhere in asia. he has been a reddit user for a long time (probably about 8-10 years-ish). we have no problems with our relationship considering the fact we're miles apart. we vidcall, sext, chat and etc every single day. 

until one day i noticed that his replies have been short and his usual sweet tone changed. i shrugged it off and thought that maybe he is stressed from work but i still tried to remain positive for him. until one day he told me someone is ""sextorting"" him. i didn't understand what he meant because i was confused. then he explained to me that he ""met"" a girl here in reddit where she chatted with him for a couple of hours until it got sexual and she sent him nudes. my bf, who apparently forgot he has a gf at that time, got ""curious"" and sent her a couple of photos of his dick. she then asked him to show her his face...which he did. he said that he knew something was off from her from the beginning but he got ""stupid"" and went on with it. turns out there was no ""girl"". it was just a group of guys who used someone's photo and pretended to be a girl for their sextortion schemes.

after that, he received threatening messages from them. telling my bf that they will expose him to his family and friends. they got a hold of his full name and other important private details. my bf said that he'd rather tell me the truth than me hearing it from ""them"". 

at first, i thought it was a really bad prank until he started crying (fyi, it was the first time i have ever heard him cry). ""they"" have tormented him for a couple of days straight until he deactivated all his social media accounts and changed some of his private documents, phone numbers, and banks to be sure and i did the same because i post a lot on instagram and facebook so that ""they"" couldn't reach him. he deleted his reddit account that he had used for years and blocked their number. 

he also decided to inform his family that a group of people is extorting him and is contemplating reporting it to the police but since the group is overseas, we are still unsure of what will happen next. it has been tough but we're trying to patch things up. all of his previous gfs cheated on him and i am the first one who remained loyal and yet he still cheated on me despite his past experience with cheaters. now we are just monitoring the situation.

"very disturbing scam call??? hopefully??? i'm in the vancouver area, doing my nightly netflix routine, and i got a call at 1:30am from a number i didn't recognize but i said eh fuck it lets answer it, what's the worst that can happen?? bad call. on the other end of the line there was a woman screaming and crying and it sounded like she was being beaten? it was very disturbing. i hung up without saying anything, blocked the number, and then called the local non emergency line to report it *just in case* it wasn't a scam call. got a call about twenty minutes later from a constable who said they'd received a couple of reports similar to this and they haven't been able to track the numbers (and offered me the number to victim services, bless his soul). 
just wondering if anyone else has received a phone call like this before? scared the shit out of me and damn near gave me a panic attack. now i can't sleep."

"tinder revenge porn so i met this girl on tinder and we started texting. soon after we added each other on snap. i was suspicious from the start, but she seemed legit over snap. eventually we got to talk about trading pics, and i was down. i wanted to make sure she was legitimate before i did, so i just asked her to send a video saying my name. she did, and after that we started trading pics. i will admit, i overlooked a lot of warning signs seeking human connection. after we exchanged pics, she started asking for weird things that i was uncomfortable with. so i told her no and just put my phone down. ten minutes later i check my phone to see that she is sending pics of my family members and saying that she is going to send all of my pics to them if i don’t send her $800. i was scared and foolish and just decided to say no and block her. before that i ended up sending a grabify link and got her ip address. so i only have her “name”, ip, and snapchat name. is there anyway i can use this information in order to find out who the person is? should i just let this go? i have terrible anxiety and shouldn’t have put myself in this situation. i am losing sleep over it. i’m sorry i know this sounds dumb and i was an idiot, but i really want to know if there is anything else i can do."

"true payday loans scam so my mum took a loan out a while back. from the place in the title (true payday loans) i tried to do some research on them, thought i found the address but when i searched, it just took me to some random street in alberta. this place had emailed her saying super threatening things, you know like things that are pretty much illegal and inappropriate, they threatened to call her work, then they did. but they've been doing it non stop. and said that they were going to keep doing it until they get their money. but the thing is, is that there are people who have completely paid them off, but they still keep calling wherever these people work, they've blocked the number but they get calls from other numbers over and over again. i told my mum that if they call again tomorrow and get the number written down. i don't want people to trace any numbers or addresses for me, i just want to know if there's a way to stop them at all. it looks like some kind of professional loans place at first. but it's not. 

she's already contacted legal support and stuff like that, and i think her work is also going to be doing the same thing. but something tells me that might not be enough to stop them. if it's not, what other options are there? because you can't really take someone to court over the internet, especially if they don't live in the same province as you, or even country as you. plus their location might be hidden or moving or something like that. but again i'm not asking for people to trace them down, i just want to know what there is to do worst case scenario."

"maybe roommate is weirdly obsessed with my bank. advise/information needed okay i am probably going to be told i am really stupid by a lot of people but i am in kinda a desperate need to move out at the moment.

so i found someone to be my roommate. they live in a different state at the moment (minnesota i think), also female, and they say they work for a military weapons company.

so i have already paid off the security deposit ($500) n crap and since that's out of the way, she's supposed to be sending the keys soon and also a check so i can pay for the equipment that is supposed to be brought into the apparentment cause she's going to work from home.

now there are two separate situations at threw me off about her recently. this one right now where she is like desperate i got to an atm to deposit the check instead of using my bank app. she is also having my print off this check to deposit as well. and another time when she wanted me to give her my bank information because she could deposit money for whatever reason (i think it was cause the day before was a market holiday but whatever). like this is raising so many read flags for me but like i don't want to like confront this person and be wrong cause that scares the crap out of me.

can i maybe get some advice as to what they might be trying to do and like what to do to get out of the situation maybe? cause it's honestly very freaky and i don't know how to handle it."

"beware of this!! [next level scam]. late last year, perhaps around august, i was scammed out of roughly $700.

i had recently moved to a new country and was trying to get a modelling side job on the go
(competed in multiple competitions in my home country and did really well, especially because the male side of the industry isn't as competitive as the female side).

i was phoned by someone telling me they'd put my through for a photoshoot in london, i had to pay a deposit- which would ""cover their time if i decided not to show up"". however, if i show up, that amount get's refunded to me.

i ended up going to the shoot, and the set was very unprofessional, however afterwards that emotional forced me into purchasing into an agreement with them.

it's difficult to explain, you would never imagine that this could be possible, but every time i was asking questions about things that didn't make sense, or doubted them they would say ""think of it as an investment, into yourself, it's silly not to go with this opportunity- and we only want people who are committed blah blah"" and it was psychology on the next level! anyway, i succumbed (what an idiot) and i paid the money and i never heard from them again, they closed down now, completely vanished.

i was unemployed at the time, and i was getting desperate for work, and working modelling clothes is a lot more favorable than having to mop floors- so i almost wanted it to work, but i shouldn't have gone with my heart.

i'm telling you this because most scams on here are so superficial that hardly anyone will fall for them- but big bad things like this exist too, especially in the modelling industry (as i came to learn after that experience).

so be on your toes, don't make rash decisions like me."

"sprint sent me a erc notice but i’ve never used sprint and i’ve lived abroad for 4 years. like the title says, i’ve been living abroad for just about 4 years now. 

a few days ago i received a letter of notice saying i owed sprint almost $1000. it was sent to my dad’s address which is where most of my very old mail like hs alumni letters and college letter go (my mom receives all my current usa stuff).

i always had verizon for my phone company and used like twc as a student when getting internet set up but always paid everything on time, and was never sent anything like this before.

i’ve received no emails, or other forms of notification of this “outstanding balance” so i’m wondering how to proceed. i don’t want to be allowing someone access to my personal info, however i’m not sure contacting erc or sprint will do much since i can’t be home to do any of the forms/police reports. 

should i just ignore it? how important is it to report stuff like this?"

"paypal scam in progress. what's his game? i got a really good deal on a (pricey) camera on offerup. we decided to do a transaction via paypal so i paid the seller via paypal's goods and services. after i paid the guy, he asks for my ph# to notify me when he gets the tracking #. 

i then noticed from his paypal info, his name is different from his name on offerup. and when i see his other offerup listings, he has similar cameras for sale.

he texts me today with a screenshot from paypal showing the payment from me is on temporary hold paypal says ""because we believe this transaction may involve a higher than usual risk.""

the guy asks me to cancel the paypal invoice somehow, assuming i have access to get my money back. so he says he doesn't know paypal that well, but he can't go through with the shipment because 14 days is ""ridiculously"" long.

that's where we are now. i smell a scam big time, and i want to cancel this transaction with paypal but when i check the transaction details i only have the ability to file a claim. what should i do?"

"i fell for a scam i'm a college student in or, usa, who, like many college boys, is on dating apps. i met one girl who had her age at over 18 back in october 2019, we talked for a bit and she asked for my number. thinking nothing of it, i gave it to her. we texted for a bit and she said she was 17, but would be 18 very soon, i figured ok sure. she then proceeded to send provocative images, i was like woah ok and sort of flirted, although didn't send any sexual images back. we didn't talk again.

3 says after i get a call at 8am from a man claiming to be a pi hired by her parents to investigate. he claims the parents ask for money for therapy and if i pay they won't take me to court nor can they do anything else unless her mental health gets worse. i panicked, tried to dig a little info, and got ""a license"" from the pi. i ended up paying around $2.2k. the pi sent a ""receipt"" for a real company in my area.

a few days ago, now in february 2020, i got an email from said pi that her family was suffering due to having to pay for therapy fees and requests money. this is where i started to think twice and made sure to ask for a letter in writing and signed by the ""father"" of the girl that he will no longer ask for money if i paid him this last time. i got the letter, and i paid the $1.3k.

as of today (2/24/2020), he emailed me again saying the father has not gotten the last payment and to call google to assist the payment with google pay, the method of which i paid the $1.3k.

i know i've clearly fallen for a scam, but i'm too poor (especially after all those payments) to hire a lawyer or pi to investigate at this point. 

is it a good idea simply to block the supposed pi's email and number? should i go to the cops if he reaches out again? i've been stressing over this for the last few days and figured i'd turn to the easiest (and cheapest) place i can, reddit."

i got scammed with counterfeit bills please spare me the comments about how stupid i am. because i’ve never felt more stupid in my life lol. anyway i was selling a nintendo switch bundle on facebook marketplace for $360. i meet up with a woman and her boyfriend who met me outside of my apartment. she claimed she had to pick up her daughter so she was in a rush. i walked up to their window and they greeted me. i showed them the console and encouraged them to test it out. my girlfriend said they looked nervous but i didn’t think anything of it. her boyfriend then reached over to hand me the money. then when i looked down to count it i realized they were blatantly fake bills. they had wrapped the fake bills with a real $5 bill so i didn’t notice it instantly. as soon as i noticed i yelled back at them and they sped off. luckily they got caught in traffic so i was able to get a picture of their license plate. i filed a police report and when the police ran the plates they said they were legit and they got their address. however i’m still concerned about whether the cops will be able to do anything at all. they told me what they did was a felony (forgery). do you guys think i have any chance of getting the console back or the money? i work so hard and it hurts to know people can just steal from others like that.
"i am 15 years old, this is how i lost $4900 to an exit scam so it all started off when i was about 12, i had managed to make a decent sum of money selling some software i made, around £1000. after this i decided to constantly re-invest my money into reselling limited street-wear such as sneakers. over the years i was able to turn this into around £10,000. i had my ups and downs.

&amp;#x200b;

it started to all go wrong in december 2019, some limited yeezys were restocking on yeezysupply (the yeezy zebra 350s) i decided to go for them. however yeezysupply was exclusively usa only at the time, but i had a solution for this i decided to use a reshipper (shipito). i was very successful when the sneakers dropped i was able to obtain 14 pairs for 265$ each after all fees and expenses. each shoe arrived at the reshipper with no issues so far, my experience with the reshipping company however was not very good (i do not recommend them) but in the end i was able to get it all sorted and they released the parcels from their hold. however they forced me to insure the parcels to the full amount i paid and declare this at customs, therefore it took shipping to the uk out of the picture as i would've netted a loss due to import duties and further shipping fees. the down-side to this was that i would no longer be able to handle the shoes myself which i had done every time before. this then meant i had to find a buyer in the us, however the company only holds parcels for up to 7 days free of charge, this meant i had to rush if i wanted to maximise profits.  


i first contacted my normal us buyer, however due to some logistical issues. so i went on a search for another buyer. i then came across someone who went under the name cali kicks.  he was very reputable in the sneaker community (much more than me) and had previously done over 500 deals with people, he owned a discord server where you would open a ticket, he'd give you a price, you send the items and then he pays. this is how it went a lot of the time if you could not meet them in person and didn't want to use a shitty payment processor such as paypal (i've had an awful experience with them). so everything seemed to be going good, he offered me a reasonable price for them 350$ to be exact (slightly higher than the uk market at the time). everything seemed to check out so far, even my friend who i knew very well had sold to him before, i then asked the reshipper to send the shoes to cali kicks. then this is where it really went wrong, when cali kicks received the shoes he deleted his server scamming a few others in the process, this is what we call an exit scam where someone builds up a massive rep over a long period of time and sacrifices it all for a large amount of money. at this point i realised i would never get the 4900$ he was suppose to pay me. i also realised he had given me his friends/familys/neighbours house to ship to. however i was able to find his actual address. i am sort of looking for advice if there's anything i can do here, i have tried sending letters however whoever lives there is not replying (i believe he lives at his parents house). he is located in pasadena ca, if anyone could help me out in any way please email [xgden@protonmail.com](mailto:xgden@protonmail.com) it would be very appreciated. thank you for reading, the lesson i learnt from this is to never go about reselling shoes this way and instead always handle them myself, this is the first time i've been scammed in this business, ironically also the first time i tried selling shoes this way."

petsitters.com is a scam here’s what they do; get your info and picture by you signing up thinking you could get a job. then they message you with some bogus identity and when you go to reply they literally steal what you wrote and put it behind a paywall saying you cannot send the message til you upgrade your plan. imma ducking ddos this shit because what they’re doing should be illegal. i feel like i was tricked into giving away my personal information as well as pictures of myself. fuck the people who designed this site. in fact i might just make a site that isn’t a scam just to put them out of business. who the fuck is gunna pay 23$ a month for your shitty messaging system when everyone already pays that to use their phone. semi end rant because i’m pissed i wasted my time with them! this won’t be the end you bastards!

question about email scam? so i received emails the past couple weeks from my school email saying that these people have my password (which is my old password that i changed some years back). all they say is the generic “i have personal pictures and history of you from 18+ sites and pay x amount of money and you’ll be ok” scam. what should i do? i’ve already changed my password again and put more 2step verification on my accounts.

"in person business scam?... there's this foreigner guy i've seen around who barely knows me, now he is not a total stranger but somewhat he is, he approached me; and asked me if i wanted to own an online business with him, i know he is a developer of the sorts, he said that i had the right set of skills; i run some instagram and twitter art pages, seems he was one of my followers.

he said he'd give me everything i need and i'd take all the credit for a 50/50... and all my duties would be of social and business nature (networking, promoting, marketing, sales and some paperwork) and he'd take care of everything else under the hood.

from what i've heard, i am not the only one to be told this by this same guy; he literally goes around doing this all the time, or well, recently, none has taken the deal.

i've thought about it myself make my own online service, i've checked, but the upfront costs of development can round the $100k to the $200k, and he doesn't have that money at all, and there's no way he can do all that by himself, but he claims he can, in like, a week. he gave me a bunch of technical diagrams then, wild business plans and methods, pages over pages of stuff i haven't read, legal frameworks; it was like an entire book of an online business making scheme, he told me not to share it under any circumstances, he gave me his contact card and left.

he told me to call a lawyer if i was worried. but of course i have no money for that.

what is this?... is it a scam?..."

"possible camgirl scam but kik element makes me unsure? hey all,  


not sure whether this will go against any formatting rules but i wanted to run something by your expertise(s). chatting to a girl from pof (hotbed of scams/bots, i know) and there's this cute girl who has a kik. we get chatting and she directs the conversation into ""rating a camshow"" as she'd been kicked off patreon etc., and immediately alarm bells are going off.  


she links me to this site and says i won't get charged if i put in her promo code ( [https://hookupselfies.com/friendfinder/?wid=5442&amp;subaffiliate=7891](https://hookupselfies.com/friendfinder/?wid=5442&amp;subaffiliate=7891) ). this site requires one to put in their email and credit card details to sign up and verify age. i am \*\*very\*\* cautious and don't enter anything - i can't find the company's contact details anywhere, or see any t's or c's.  


the thing that's bugging me is she has sent me live photos on kik (that have 'camera' under the photo) which means they could only have been sent real time... right? and they look very similar to the top three photos on the website i linked above.   


my instinct is to just block and move on but the kik element makes this potential scam more interesting. any thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated!"

my email contains important info about your future life! please read this very very carefully.  


this is bogachev. aka slavik on the dark web.  
i spent my whole life working on digital security apps, besides i am really a very good hacker - if not the best.  


i think around 9 months ago, i hacked this email address of yours. don't believe me? you can check it. i am sending this email from your own email box now. (my email adress)  


i injected my code to all the devices which you had opened your mailbox on. and i started to monitor the activity on your devices. my first idea was to block and encrypt your files. afterwards, i would ask for a small fee to release them back. but than one day, you visited some dirty websites. you know what i mean naughty thing. and i silently activated your front camera and recorded you. yes! you were playing with yourself. what a funny video.  


now, i stole your contact list. i also have all your friends lists. a lot of information was downloaded to my system. checking your system with the antivirus systems will of course not work. i told you, i am not a rookie!  


what do i want?  
well i am asking from you a small fee of 500 usd. this is the cost of my time, and i had spent quite a lot of time on you.  
if you don't pay my fee, be sure that all the naughty screen videos will be delivered to your friends and family.  
no i am not kidding, this is business.  
but if you cooperate with me, i promise that i will delete these files as soon as i receive the payment. i will not need them anymore. business is business.

if you had never purchased bitcoins before, i suggest you to act quickly. the first time orders may take some time and you have limited time!  


my dear; be smart, do not ignore me! do not trust the devices and security programs, they never really protect you. do not click on every link you see. always use stronger passwords on the internet. and the golden rule: never trust anybody!

"the ""dumb girlfriend"" play not sure what tag this would fall under but i got hit with one today, so i thought i should find somewhere to share it, also sorry if this is a terrible read, i'm not used to posting things like this

it begun by a female placing an order for delivery over the phone at my work, i won't bore you with the details of the order but the amount ended up totalling just over 1000 dollars, she gave me the address, put it under what she led me to be her boyfriends number, complete with phone number and all, then came time to pay for the order. i didn't click onto this at the time but i'm certain she was also calling from an anonymous number, she read out her card number, expiry date and when i asked for the cvv (card verification value) she told me it was a virtual mastercard and as such it didn't have one, not knowing any better and having no reason to doubt her i accepted this. payment went through, order placed, have a nice day, yada yada. a couple hours later a lady came into the shopfront, wearing glasses, saying she placed an order over the phone but she completely misunderstood what her boyfriend needed and actually only needed around a third of the original order. everyone laughs about it, no worries, i'll just refund what you don't need now. (i'm sure you can already see where this is going) refund goes through, everyone's happy, she leaves the store. the next day is when we're meant to be delivering the timber, all goes well, no one is on site, which isn't uncommon for our nature of work, and the orders already paid for so it should be fine. lo and behold i get a call later on that day from a woman (different from the original female caller) confused as to why she has all these things she didn't order out the front of her house, i confirm her address is definitely the one given on the order, she tells me she'll check with her neighbours if they ordered anything, and i tell her i'll try chase it up from my end. now's when i try and call the number on the order and it begins going straight to voicemail, odd but not completely out of the ordinary, que ""well it's all paid for so i guess we can only wait until this person calls asking where his stuff is"". fast forward to two days later when we get the fateful email telling us that the order taken over the phone was from a stolen card, and has been reported for fraud. that's when all the weird occurrences from this entire ordeal piece together into an annoyingly well played out scam, lady orders over phone with stolen card, places order under fake name.and gives dodgy phone number then comes into store, gets bulk of the order refunded onto a different card, takes different card straight to atm and draws money out before bank can cancel the refund, leaving no trace because she didn't have to put anything into her name. we managed to get the goods that we ordered back but the play clearly wasn't for the goods, but instead the refund of money"
"accidentally sexted a potential minor, parents ask for money, i'm thinking it may be a scam i just today started talking to a girl, we flirted, things escalated quickly, started sending nudes. i thought she looked about in her early to mid 20s based on pictures. she had her age iirc set to 18 in her profile. i got a text later telling me it's her parents and they took her phone. the dad calls me and lets me know she's actually underage. i apologize, tell him i won't try to contact her again. so then he asks me to send $600 for a new laptop his wife needs or he'd press charges.


in good faith, i offered to pay the full $1000 for it, and i do after some trouble with different methods sending money, but then he asks for $1000 again, but paypal wasn't able to send it i guess because of a fraud alert maybe even though i confirmed it was valid after i tried paying. their offices were closed so i couldn't call customer service. he upped it again to $1500 for the wait, and had me go try to get money from an atm to buy prepaid debit cards. i don't remember my pins for any of my cards though and i don't have the actual money in my account to send.


he keeps threatening that ""if we can't get it done tonight i'll press charges"" and then i get home he suddenly changes his tune so it's suddenly okay if we do it first thing in the morning. i'm wondering if this is actually just someone pretending to have texted as a young woman to later pretend to be the parents and demand money. or you guys think this is a serious threat? also wondering if r/legaladvice would be of help."

"releasepay debit mastercard here’s one for you. this may not be the right place to post this, since it’s a government agency involved in the scam, but here goes:

if you get arrested in elko county, nevada, you get booked and processed into elko county jail, run by the elko county sheriff’s dept. they take an inventory of your personal property to return to you upon your release. but if any of that property is cash/currency, then when you get released they give you a handy dandy little debit mastercard with your cash loaded onto it, less the $45 booking fee you have to pay them  for going there. this card comes with a pin number that doesn’t work, and there’s a fee for anything you can possibly do with it, including a $3 fee to withdraw cash from an atm (in addition to the atm owners fee), a $2 fee for attempting to get cash from an atm but not getting it (e.g. if you enter the pin shown on the card, which is wrong).

they have a website that tells you you can transfer the money to another account of your choice but provides no way to do so. calling customer service gets you transferred to a representative if you have any question about any of the issues i just mentioned, but that leads to a message telling you customer service is closed. they’re open from 7-7, m-f, mountain standard time.

so the state troopers of nevada, the elko county sheriffs department, and apparently mastercard are all involved in a conspiracy to steal money from anyone who gets caught in one of their obvious speed traps.

"encountered a scammer trying to ""sextort"" me or at least i believe that's what was going on. a suspicious account using a picture of a young woman friend requested me on facebook. after i accepted, the person messaged me and started asking me questions about sex (whether i enjoyed it, etc.). i said yes and they asked me to call them on facebook messenger. i put a piece of tape over my webcam and called. i got a black screen at first, but when this person called me back after we disconnected, there actually was an attractive woman on screen (but not the same person who is in her facebook pictures). i asked her to show me her eyes (she was only showing the lower half of her face at first), and when she gave me a full view of her face i took a screenshot. ""she"" also said her microphone wasn't working, which leads me to believe someone else was talking to me on facebook messenger while she was on camera. eventually she just disconnected. 

my question is, is there anything i should do about this? i'm privy to this scam so i didn't give them any information, but they're obviously still trying to scam others. and on top of that, i actually have a screenshot of the woman on camera. i know that often these women are victims of sex trafficking, so i'm not sure if i should report this to the police, or if it would even be helpful."

it seems to take the basic premise of sweatcoin, but the advert i saw (ironically as one of the ads on sweatcoin), claimed that by walking you could generate money.

the main examples it showed was that you could generate money onto an amazon gift card, or just generate real money (dollars in this example even though i’m in the uk).

bitcoin emails this may not be the correct place to post this but has anyone been getting frequent bitcoin related emails? i have about six-a-day - it’s only been in that last few weeks. they all go straight to junk but it’s odd.
"anyone else keeps getting friend requests on steam from people with a link and chinese letters in their name? in  the past few days i kept getting friend requests from people with a  link, chinese letters and a bunch of numbers and letters at the end of  their name and i wanted to ask if anyone else is getting these and how  could i avoid them? so far i've blocked every single one, but it still  makes me uncomfortable that someone is trying to scam/phish me.

thank you all.

"""gmail-user-name, are you there?"" type of spam? that's all the mail says, ""re-(my gmail account name), are you there?"" 

sometimes it's ""(my gmail account) hello! this is my new email!"" 

sometimes it has three linked box that are ""yes"", ""no"" and ""maybe"" or something of the sorts, for me to answer. and the emails are supposedly sent from different women's names..which i don't know (susen, lisa etc..). the line usually starts with a ""re-mandarine221"" like, *i* wrote *them* first and they're responding to me (which i haven't. obviously). 

now, i know these are spam emails the same way i know emails i get from fed ex are scam: i don't live in an english speaking country... so i don't have fed ex or ever used it. also they all land in my spam box. also, i always check to see the the email who sent it and spam emails usually have a weird address like fghhr35465xcht-nonsense sort of thing? (via amazon, too) but these emails have addresses like henriyeta94@, like a legit sounding name. 

it became alarming when some of these ""are you there?"" messages got through to my day-to-day email box! i marked them as spam and fishing attempt.

but i'm curious what it's all about. usually spam emails are pretty clear (especially the ones with the fake fed ex, paypal, the *""i have a tough life pls help my child and support him by sending me money""* (it was a very specific request... about a mother asking a complete online stranger to look after her child because he's about to inherit millions and his family wants him gone but he helps take care of her.. and he's only thirteen. like, you really expect someone to believe that??). my favorite is the latest fake ""*your google account has been hacked""* spam, which is just sad how little effort the scammer put into the screen shot of my google account supposedly being  being ""*hacked.""))*"

"someone got control of a relative's whatsapp account and most likely his number too. he blocked sim card number already and asked whatsapp to deactivate his account, to which whatsapp replied, it's now deactivated. before 30days, it could still be activated by sms or phone number. 

but the scammer's whatsapp is still messaging people. how did that happen?

also, what other precautions he needs to take? i changed the social numbers in all his social medias and had encouraged him to contact the bank just in case the identity fraud goes too far. we've also tried to contact as many people as possible to not answer the scammer."

"am i being scammed? background info i was looking for a job on carousell n saw one that said easy online job (looked too good to be true? check.) i chatted with the seller etcetc n she told me the jobs avail. she sent me some pictures of ppl earning good money from this job n the certificate to show that her company (in china) is legal. the pictures were like 240p. the job i wanted had quite good pay $200-300 for the amt i had to do

thats not the biggest problem. they wanted me to pay an advance fee of $100 bcos the job that i wanted (art helper which was to help ppl make art they send me the required materials (no need to pay) n i do the art then i mail back to them). they said that the fee was placed bcos many ppl could just sign up n mia which was not good for them. understandable, but i was still suspicious.

so i did some research n found a website that taught me how to confirm if a business was legally set up in china. there was a website (name in chinese) n u just needed to type the business’s 18 digit registration number. it was in the pictures she sent so i checked n it was a legitimate company. 

at this point i thought that ok this is a legit company. but then i went to search the company name n google came up to this blog of a chinese person informing ppl of company names that scammers use. i looked thru the whole list n suddenly i saw a company name that was almost exact to the one that was hiring me. the difference was the one that was hiring me was called jane doe (made up) but the one that was a scam company was called mary jane (made up)

i m so confused shld i pay the fee n take the risk of being scammed?"

"new apple credit card scams can you imagine somebody at the club / bar drunk with 5000$ cash in their pocket? well that’s not far from the reality nowadays with this new and very lucrative scam that nobody is talking about. 

how it’s done - thieves will target people at clubs and bars, (because drunk people are easiest to steal from) they will steal their phones , and get their 4-6 digit lock screen passwords one way or another. after that they will search through the victims photo / email / message history until they find the victims ssn. 
when they have the ssn + apple id (which is already signed in to the phone) that’s all they need to sign up for apple credit card.

with a little good credit and a few taps. thieves now have opened a credit line with apple pay and will be ready to spend 5,10,20k. the thieves don’t have to worry about getting a card in the mail, they only have to use the phone to make purchases. and when they’re done spending , they sell the phone for the cherry on top. 

thieves can buy iphones / apple gift cards and resell for massive profits. considering 1 phone can net a thief 5-10k or more, this scam is going to spread like wildfire"

"wish.com fraudulent charges hi first time poster, not sure if this belongs here. my wish.com account has been hacked by someone from russia. the person immediately made a purchase of 7 tablets in the amount of $350 and then proceeded to cancel the order. the result was my account was granted wish cash which is not refundable. the person then proceeded to use the credits on the account to send actual stuff (mostly electronics) and sent them to the address at russia. i knew of this quickly because i have been robbed of my wallet 2 years ago and so have setup my bank account to text me every card transaction. the person changed my wish password and it wasn't until the products were ordered, that i regained access to it again. i have so far contacted my bank who had (once again) cancelled my debit cards and put up an investigation. i am hopefully waiting for my account to be credited by next wed.

if you have wish or have used it, pmease consider changing your password to a strong one. i admit mine wasn't that strong, but that doesn't change the fact that an unauthorized access was done to gain funds to perform a fradulent transaction against me."

she texted me today saying this person has been trying to reach out to me. i can’t download imgur at the moment so i will try to post screenshots later.

this person emailed her from ancestry . email . ancestry .com saying “good morning i was looking at my matches this am and am wondering how i’m related to [moms full name with no spaces]? thank you lyla”

and another about 2 mins later saying “i guess you manage [myinitials] account so that is my dna match thanks lyla”

to me, these seem super weird because of the grammar. she is upset that i think so and genuinely thinks someone is trying to reach me. 

is this some sort of scam? i tried to log into my ancestry account from way back when but can’t see if this person really tried to reach me."

"i need advice. hey all. i have an older cousin with that keeps getting scammed by “women” on various chat apps. the last time this happened, he lost his apartment, and his son over it, and was homeless for a bit. my family and i had to scramble to find him a place to live, and it was really stressful for everyone involved. for a period of about 3 weeks, my entire life was finding him an affordable place to live. it placed incredible strain on my marriage, and on my parent’s marriage as well. i think he sent upwards of $25,000 to various “women” that he’d met online. after things settled back down, after we’d found him a room to rent, after he’d filed for bankruptcy, he *swore* to us that it wouldn’t happen again, and things were good for about two years. he had saved up about $4000, and was doing pretty well. 

today at work (i work at our family business) i got a call from my mother, and she simply stated “(cousin) did it again.” i went over to my folk’s house, and walked in on a heated phone conversation between my mom, and cousin. i heard that he had sent this “woman” in “witchita” $3000, and mom had told him that she couldn’t do this for a fourth time. (the first time was when he was $72,000 in debt due to scams, and rampant spending and had to sell his house.)

i know it sounds really heartless, but we can’t keep doing this. he makes more than my parents and i do *combined*... and then gives it to scammers. each time it happens, we explain to him that there’s no svetlana, kelly isn’t stuck in cameroon, pam has a really heavy indian accent for living in san jose, and finally that janet is just like the rest. there were more, but i forgot the names. i want to help him, i want him to be okay, i just don’t know how to do it. have any of you had something similar happen with a family member? were you able to help them stop it?"

"sim swapped beware i got sim swapped this morning around 4 am from california while i was asleep in texas. this morning around 3:30 my sim was swapped by what i believe was a t mobile employee with access to this function from home or from their work location.

i woke up this morning to no service which i thought was unusual, so i trouble shoot myself to no avail, i go to a store front just to be asked repeatedly if i switched the sim which started to aggravate me to the point where i refused their solution of buying a new sim card so i went to the next one down the road. she pulls up my account and calls the employee customer service which the first store didn’t even do, the tech mentions my sim was switched at 3:30 am and bypassed the “go ahead” from me (which can only be done by a t mobile employee). we get it resolved at the store and i’m at a loss because i don’t know anybody who would have the capacity to do this to me. she mentions to check my other accounts to make sure they’re up to date and safe. first thing i do is check my main email which had also been compromised due to the 2 step factor being trumped by them getting my sim and entering through their own iphone. i get multiple emails with password changes and coinbase password reset, followed by receipts for conversions, a failed attempt to purchase 3 bitcoin thru my bank, then a lump sum payment to a bitcoin wallet.
already submitted a ticket, but what else can i do besides changing passwords?

"""account services"" call? hi r/scams,  


i recently got a call from an ""account services"" caller id regarding a hospital visit i had earlier last year. they claimed to have sent mail to an old address and said that i owed money to a separate entity besides the hospital and that the bill had now been sent to a collections company.  


he gave me some account number and sent me to mymedicalpayments.com where it did detail some of the same services provided on the same day that i was in the hospital. the line item was fairly generic but it did mention the er, which i did visit.  


i told the guy on the phone that i know his company buys these debts for pennies on the dollar and that he had a lot of wiggle room to dilute the payment, which made him bring it down to $180 from the supposed $860 i owed.   


is this a real phone call or am i being taken for a ride? i don't have any outstanding payments hitting my credit right now and quite frankly can't afford one. i can barely afford the deal he's giving me but would be devastated if i gave these people this money and then it turned out to be a scam.

( the bank probably found out it was a scam and shut the acct down) i told him it was too late and then don't hear anything for 24 hrs..i send a threat of reporting things to the bank and authorities and he quickly says that he will send the bird that week. the day i am supposed to get the bird i get a call from the carrier that i will have to make a refundable rental payment of $1800-3000 or they will not ship my bird..total bullshit alarm is going off now..oh i noticed that both the seller and shipper are using google voice numbers from colorado...what a strange coincidence! so at this point i said i am not paying another dime and came here to warn people away from that bird site [brightbirdshome.com](https://brightbirdshome.com/)&lt;  and the shipping company kingslogisticsint.com &lt; learn from my mistake."

"buyer beware! illinois fishing licenses (il) **buyer beware!**

&amp;#x200b;

if buying an illinois (il) fishing license online, you might get scammed. two issues i ran into:

# never received my digital copy - forced to pay fee for reprint

&amp;#x200b;

i purchased mine over the phone using the number provided on the site since my dnr account info needed updated. my credit card was charged, they updated my account info, and i was told i'd receive my copy of the license by e-mail. 2 days later, and i never received it. not in the spam folder or elsewhere, either. i spent hours on the phone trying to get this resolved. a customer service agent from one line would transfer me to the other line, and vice-versa, over and over. i was forced to pay an extra fee for a reprint. not cool!

# license i bought was for the previous year, not this year

&amp;#x200b;

then i notice on my license that it expires in about a month. i just paid for an annual 1-yr. license - so what happened? turns out, buried in the il dnr faq (hosted on a separate site), they mention that licenses for the new year become available on march 1. so if you buy a new license, you must wait until april otherwise you will get cheated. their main websites should have mentioned this upfront, and the ordering system should know better. trying to resolve this amicably with il dnr was unsuccessful; they simply told me that they won't refund my license fee or update the expiration. so i'm forced to pay the full amount again in about 30 days, for a 1 year fishing license. this is a scam or at the very least, negligence on the part of illinois dnr and their online system.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

shame on you, illinois. it's no wonder their fishing license renewals have dropped dramatically (source: [https://www.outdoornews.com/2018/03/26/illinois-drop-fishing-license-sales-dnr-worried/](https://www.outdoornews.com/2018/03/26/illinois-drop-fishing-license-sales-dnr-worried/) ).

"this is a scam, right? (sugar daddy talking about steam cards) last night a man on grindr told me he wants to be my sugar daddy with a weekly allowance. sounds great.

then came the “terms”. oh boy.

due to my past experience with sugar babies, i decided that before you can be on my payroll you'd have to get an steam card so my accountant would generate a reference number before you can be added to my payroll bc it's a company account.
i hope you understand.

the steam card is a one card with so many options, so my accountant needs the card voucher to generate a reference number before you can be on my payroll to be able to be receiving your allowance weekly

"pimp threatening to kill family if i didn't pay them money received a text stating that they were a pimp in a cartel and that i had wasted their hooker's time. if i didnt send them $1500, they would kill members of my family. they then listed my address, my spouse's name, the names of our parents, my siblings, and various other members of my family. they even sent pictures of dismembered body parts. 

honestly freaked me out at first, but i realized they could probably find all this information online by looking up my phone number. the local police were notified and they took a report, but agreed that it was  a scam trying to get me to send them money."

4th story

&amp;#x200b;

so i was actually convinced to buying this guys method a few months ago but didn't have the money on me and had to think about it.

he said he's selling methods and its no scam

he said 100 a day is  30$ and 700 a day is 100$

and im investgating on what this guy is doing to make 700$ or more a day

he told he's currently making 700 a day and that it wasn't drugs nor was it illegial(this was all in dm's btw) and he said before i pay thats all hes telling me.

so i check his story and he said he can make 1500 within an hour and thats it guaranteed on is 4th story.

i was convinced at first cause hes actually making money in a way but idk how. im guessings hes selling fake methods and scams to make money. but i can't judge fully because i haven't bought any of his methods"
"understanding a scammer's motivation backstory: my wife owns a small fitness franchise in the us. today, she got a call from someone with an australian accent asking if he could buy his girlfriend a fitness pass. my wife said yes of course. 

he then asked if they took american express. when she said yes, he said ""are you sure?"" and  proceeded to keep her on the phone for as long as possible.

the call felt odd to her, so she posted on her franchise's forums, and it turns out between 40-50 other franchise owners in different cities have received the same calls in the last week.

he never asked for any compromising information, but he seemed to keep all of the franchise owners on the phone and talking as long as possible. they felt he was trying to keep them on the phone to continue talking and asking the same questions over and over almost as though he was trying to get them to phrase something a certain way (i.e. recording them?)

we figured there's a good chance he could call back in a couple weeks and finish his scam, but the concern is that he's recording voices to use against their clients.

it's hard to defend yourself against something like this when you're really not sure what their motivation is. any advice would be appreciated."

no correspondence about or to the window company was done on any of my accounts. not even through texts. i was not the one that set up the appointment or paid for it.  i'm concerned as to how these scammers know what company to pose as to get me to click. is this a coincidence?"
"beware of click2sell.co this site is operating under the guise of an online advertising platform but it is an outright scam. we trusted them and invested our savings us$90,000 into click2sell.co because we believed in the very friendly and convincing lies of their team members scott g and lee t wanting to help us use this money to make extra money for our charities. scott told us that this platform always makes money and that he has never seen it actually lose money before but obviously that’s because it makes 100% profit for them because it’s not even real! 
after transferring our funds mid last year they insisted on me emailing copies of all of my identification documents including passport and to sign a so called ‘bonus agreement’ before they could “activate” my account. i had no choice but to do this or they apparently couldn’t activate my account. at first it all looked good on the screen and they say “your account is ticking over nicely” but when it comes to withdrawing your money you can’t! they verbally assured us that we can withdraw easily anytime. we have not been able to withdraw a single cent of our money after six months of excuses and countless hours of the run around on the phone to multiple different people, getting passed from one new ‘fake name person’ to another only to have them say the “customer relations manager” tell us our account manager will be reprimanded for mismanaging our account and that we now have no money in our account to withdraw. 

they literally stole our entire us$90,000. australian authorities are now onto them and we have been assisting them. we have given click2sell a deadline to return our funds to us. we will update this review if that happens. 

this money we had saved for over 20 years of good intentions to make a greater difference in the world is now in the hands of heartless criminals. i obviously made a big mistake trusting their lies and have been left extremely traumatised and at times suicidal after learning such a harsh lesson from the dark side of humanity and it hurts me to watch my darling 60 year old husband having to deal with these scammers and the worry i can see he has about my mental health and our financial future. 

everything is energy, you can not harm another without harming yourself. i have no doubt karma will come calling for all of those involved in this scam... so be it.

"my mother just passed away. in going through her things, i found she was being catfished for money. as the title says, my mother unexpectedly away a month ago. while trying to wrap up her estate, we found her entire retirement was gone. digging further, i discovered a weird email that led me down the rabbit hole piecing together the last two years of her life. ultimately, i found she was being catfished by a guy pretending to be in the army and stationed in afghanistan. she was planning to run away with him when he got back to the states, but to no surprise, he kept delaying it by saying his orders got extended. meanwhile, it was your typical gift card scam. i don't know why my mother was so naive because she was a banker for 40 years or why she was doing this to my father, but none of that matters now. 

in wine drunk anger, i messaged the guy on her account telling him i knew he was a scammer. he told me i was an idiot and that i should respect him  because he'll be my new stepfather (i'm 34 and i never told him my mother was dead when he asked about her). when i threatened police, he told me he'd be stateside may 30th and he'd pay it all back. obviously that's a joke.

they've communicated on whatsapp, a random email address to an acquaintance, and two of what i'm sure are google voice (or something similar) numbers. 

realistically speaking, is there any possible way i can get this guy? i'm sure there's not but just running through options."

yesterday this older woman called from california, claiming to have received a check from our bank. she gives me the routing and account numbers- the routing number is ours, and the account number does seem to be one of ours. however, the number doesn’t show up in our system when i punch it in. 

while i work to try to find the account, she explains she was offered a position as a “secret shopper” and was to get money orders from &lt;chain grocery store&gt; and send those back. at this point alarm bells are going off, so i advise her the check is most likely illegitimate. she says she was worried as much. we exchange numbers and i tell her i need to contact our fraud department, and i will reach out to her when i have more information. 

i shoot fraud department an email outlining the situation. this morning, they get back to me telling me to get in touch with this lady and ask for pictures of the check and anything else that came with it. she obliges- my supervisor recognizes the account as one that was closed about 18 months ago because it was compromised. fraud is going to look into the situation further, and i’m thanking cthulhu this lady at least looked up and called us before falling for this scam. 

thanks for listening."

"package scam any truth to the following?
context being a discrete package shipped to me via the following company has hit this ‘roadblock’

“accept warm greetings form southern airway shippers, world's no.1 logistics company in land, sea and air freight forwarding since 2009


your package is currently on hold and needs immediate action from you so that it could be put back on transit and unto our delivery vans


once we were done with the custom department, as airport security routine all packages had to pass through the food and drug administration (fda) for proper examining. from all the indications, this has been a regular check in your state lately for some reasons best know to your state jurisdiction. this department has the duty of reviewing the result of laboratory, animal and human clinical testing of packages getting into the state at the airport. according to the fda, the most assured way to them to do this is by tearing open the package and conducting the stipulated test. this will be registered, confirmed, documented and a certificate called the fda certificate will be issued.

in other words, any package that is legally backed with this document doesn't have to go through all this process, rather we will just have to present the document. we are informing you about this because of the terms in which your package was shipped, it was clearly stated that it shouldn't be opened by anyone. but this cant hold at this point where the state and law are involved. so as of now, the only option we have now is to procure you a post check fda certificate to restrict the authorities form opening your package for the test to be conducted. to produce this document you will have to pay a refundable sum of $400 for this certificate. this means you will be getting your package and $400 you paid for this document. 


amount required for the fda certificate of your package

total amount :$400

total refund :$400
 
disclaimer 

failure to comply with the custom authority will lead to serious trouble with the dea ""drug enforcement agency""
failure to comply with the custom authority with 24 hours will lead to a warrant of arrest immediately.
you will be faced with 4 to 6 years imprisonment for drug trafficking because your information was found on the package( full name,house address,email address,phone number)”"

"g-pa got scammed by fake microsoft, apparently had some of our docs on the pc. what now? so apparently my grand father-in-law got fooled by an indian scammer saying he was microsoft. all i could get out of him (he is grumpy now) is they called him and convinced him to hit windows key+r and type something in, then there was blue line or something on the screen. so probably got remote access to the machine. 

unfortunately it turns out that this particular pc was given to him, a computer illiterate 70 year old, by my mother-in-law, which she did without wiping or deleting anything on the computer, or even checking to see what was on it. well, it turns out years ago, when we were living with her for a time, we did our taxes on that computer and copies of the tax forms and other documents were on it. (i have yet to go over and look at the actual files, this is what mil told me)

so, if they were able to get access to and possibly download everything and find those docs, i have to assume that not only do they ssn's for myself, my wife, and our two kids who we claimed as dependants (i think we have to put their numbers to claim them, right?), but also,  i believe the account and routing numbers for our checking account were on there for the refund to be deposited.

so far, we have started a new checking account and are transferring old one over and are looking at identity protection services (recommendations?). what else should we be doing?

and does anybody know the sop that these scammers use? what can we expect them to try to do with this info?"

"am i selling my puppy to scammers? so i adopted a pit bull pup last weekend and was really excited about him until my apartment complex told me that he was a restricted breed and i couldn't keep him there. (the restricted breed rule is not written anywhere on the website or in any information i'd received, but that's not the point here) i posted him online to try to find him a new home asap and immediately received a response in a text message.

the attached screen shots show our whole conversation. i was getting red flags from the beginning, ""we the family"" etc., but figured i was just being a bit paranoid cuz i didn't want to give up the dog. when i received the last message that he sent this morning i started to think i should have listened to the red flags. 

he's sending me a money order or cashiers check for $1,490 when we talked about $125 and he never mentioned that i would have to pay the ""pet movers."" (which is what it sounds like the rest of the $ is for) the fact that he'd send a check for this much is concerning and it seems strange that he would send it when i could easily keep it and not give him the dog. (i won't, but still) i'm not sure how a scam like this would work if it is one, but i don't want to deposit the check if something fishy is going on. i was planning on just cashing it and then depositing the cash later, but if i'll need to pay the ""pet movers"" over $1000 i probably can't do that. 

does this set off red flags for anyone else? this dog has been with me almost a week now and i've grown pretty attached so i don't want anything bad to happen to him either. maybe i'm just being paranoid, but i'd appreciate any advice anyone has.

someone called me from my county's ""sherrif department"" saying he was a process server and going to deliever papers at my residence or my job between the hours of 3-5pm. he then said if i had any questions or concerns to call 8327693012. (mind you i live in north texas. this callback number is in houston, not anywhere near here).

well the bastard then called my sister and she freaked out and called me and i am beyond pissed off. what gives people the right to call and scare my family? 

anyways i ended up getting frustrated and called the sheriff department they claimed to be from. the lady on the phone has never heard of the name (brad matthews) and the phone number i gave isnt recognisable. she told me it might be a scam but then again she doesnt know what numbers process servers use either. after talking to her more she said process servers usually dont call they either leave their card or try again later. 

if someone can give me some peace of mind id appreciate it. theyve been blowing up my phone and my sisters leaving all these threatening voicemails and i dont know what to do. i already reported the number last night and then this morning they called again. 

i heard process servers dont contact the individual and they dont leave a callback number that isnt within the jurisdiction. also ""brad"" stated on the phone ""if you dont sign these papers you will miss your court date."" i thought if you don't get served the court date won't be active?

"a great way to hurt scammers--- post their details / info online!!!! i notice a lot of ""i got scammed"" posts on here but most victims don't give any details.

do you want to hurt scammers?

create a title ""this guy is a scammer..."" and in the post, thread, review, etc you list details like email address, phone number, name, address, fake company, their ig, skype, instagram etc... and the nature of the scam...

the easiest way to get scammers information is to ""pretend"" to fall for their scam. they will then send you all their info. then, pretend to have problems sending money and the scammers will bend over backwards figuring out a way to solve your problems. get them to mail you something, ask for a mailing address to send a money order, ask for their facebook, ig, etc etc....

take their information and create a yelp review or post on a forum and then whenever someone else later does a google search, they pop up :)

this means that that scammers have to go through the trouble of creating an entire scammer infrastructure again, a new fake name, number, address, ig, facebook, email, website, domain name, etc...

depending on the scammer's infrastructure, it can take hours if not days for them to completely recover (i.e. to get a legit business address they can exploit, etc). and set themselves back up. this easily and collectively adds up.

look, your money is gone, nothing you can do about it. but vengeance will make you feel a little better. and this ""hurts"" the scammers. they hurt you, so hurt them back!"

i sent a text to him saying i’m the guy from ebay. he asks about the condition and i assure him the quality is near-mint. he replies asking for my paypal email so he can pay me “directly to my paypal acc via ebay”.
that’s where i left it to come to this subreddit for some insight. what do you guys think ?"

"half price on amazon, marked as new hi guys, new to the sub. i'm asking for your help since i have little to no experience in +100$ purchases on the internet. 
i was searching for a gaming pc on amazon, i've found megaport (i suppose a legitimate retailer) and i was looking on the various options. on the bottom right amazon offered other retailers and there were two; selling the same product new and used like new but at half the price. 
example: [amazon link](https://www.amazon.it/gp/offer-listing/b079g4hfd8/ref=mw_dp_olp?ie=utf8&amp;condition=all) (this is not the pc i want to buy, i used the most expensive to show the absurdity)

so lesson for today is be cautious, but i'm sure you all know that already. just don't act without doing research.

"luxury goods reseller scammer hi everyone. so i got scammed out of $400 from an instagrammer who i was referred to. now this guy used to do legit work, hence my referral, but suddenly he’s just decided to scam and deactivate his account. his instagram was @messiahclosetdrip 
the game: 
this individual claims to have hookups at holt renfrew in toronto, canada and based on stories and posts, they seem legit. they ask for the money up front to an auto deposit e-transfer account (which in hindsight is a massive red flag but with the referral, i was okay... sadly) and then they claim to have shipped your item out and will provide you tracking details soon. soon never comes and then they deactivate their account or block you and disappear. 

so i’m out $400, which, truthfully is a small price to pay to learn my lesson but i want to share. 

be careful with resellers as it’s a flourishing market these days."

"wasting credit card scammer's time a while ago, i used to get multiple calls claiming that ""i have won x amount"" , or ""my credit card rewards points are about to expire, turn them into cash"" etc etc. usually i would just hang up, but a few times i just decided to have fun. 
here are a few instances of me wasting their time.

*i am on mobile, so formatting may suck*


s: scammer

m:me


scam 1

s: hello, i am speaking from xyz bank, you hold their credit card?

m: yeah, what's this about?

s: i see that you have not used the reward points and they are about to expire. you can turn them into cash which will be added to your bank account. 

m: hmmm... really? bank never told me about this when i was given the card. i thought my reward points do not expire.

s: ya its a new policy. just give me last for digits of the card and i can get this started.

m: wow ok. hang on i'll get my card

i left him hanging for about 4-5 mins, and i'd come back everytime to explain that i am having trouble finding the card. just hold on. he caught on after a while and hung up. lol. 

scam 2

s: hello, i am calling from xyz bank, you hold their credit card?

m: no i have abc bank's card. 

s: oh ok. 

he hung up. but after 2 mins, i get another call. 

s: hello, i am calling from abc bank, you hold their credit card?

m: no i have def bank's card.

he hung up and again i get a call.

s: hello, i am calling from def bank, you hold their credit card?

m: credit card? i don't even have a bank account!

s: you don't have a bank account? ... really? you are saying you don't hold a bank account?

m: ya absolutely, i keep all money hidden in a mattress buried in cemetery. if you want to scam me, you are gonna have to dig up a whole lot of bodies.

s: *click*.

a couple other times i told them lies like i have not paid my cc bill, so let the points expire, and while you are at it, cancel my card. a colleague of mine told me once that when he got the call, he said, ""hey i am having sex right now, call me later"". he could hear them giggling before they hung up. 


i don't get these calls anymore, and honestly sometimes i miss it!"

"my ordeal with a scam forex broker and how i outsmarted them the issue about umarkets forex broker   is that they are pretty smart fraud brokers but the good news is you can always outsmart them. i'll share the experience of a colleague of mine who traded with them, unfortunately he was defrauded by the accounts manager phillip morgan but good news he was still able to recover his losses. i'll go into details bout his ordeal with these scammer, their hidden policies, the actions we took to initiate a recoup of the investments made and a possible way to outsmart them.

&amp;#x200b;

**the ordeal**

fred started trading with them in the second quarter of 2019 up until november 2019 here's their strategy, they got him to invest as little as 750 euros at first and they actually gave him returns on investment which made it such a juicy offer to jump into. his account manager convinced him to invest as much as 41,750 euros to get 100% bonus and 50% profit guaranteed for a start. they advised him to use the abra crypto wallet to send the funds so as to ease the transactions and evade limits and fees of international bank wire. so he put some money in his account, attached his debit card to his abra account, purchased bitcoin worth the amount and sent to the bitcoin wallet address provided by the accounts manager. he watched his investment grow tremendously and was happy, his accounts manager advised him to even invest more in order to accumulate more profit and enjoy maximum benefits and bonuses. so subsequently, fred sent bitcoin through the abra bitcoin wallet on four different occasions; 62,000, 97,000, 156,000 euros respectively for the sake of investment. at this point, he wanted some returns on his investment so he could invest in some real estate project he was involved in but he was vehemently refused by his accounts manager after they stated some of their lame policies which was unknown to him as he was not told before he started investing. so they told him he could withdraw his investments but he had to pay taxes to withdraw which was 19,900 euros after which they stopped replying his texts, emails and picking calls from fred,accumulating to a total sum of 376,650 euros. after this ordeal with umarkets, he was certain he had been scammed, he shared his experience with me so we knew we had to act immediately. 

we resorted to making extra research on the firm so as to know how to tackle the situation, here's what we found: 

1. the complex nature of their ownership, they are registered in belize but this does not mean they are regulated by the recognized bodies in the countries of their target investors. also the actual owners are listed in cyprus and there's no cysec regulation for the brokerage, fyi.
2. another point we found was their withdrawal policy which leaves me with chills. you are allowed to withdraw your investments and roi but only until the rollover is met.the rollover is $10,000,000 (yes that’s right, $10 million) for every $1,000 you deposit, that’s insane! else they take the bonus away, and all the proceeds, without warning if you don’t meet their volume or balance requirements. this is a form of extortion and a huge scam!!!!
3.  also, umarkets got lots of complaints dating back to the companies found in 2014. the complaints all center around money and how bonus ties up profits, account balances disappear and access to accounts are denied. to their credit, umarkets falsefully tries to address their situation all for clout and show off to the public. particularly, there were regulatory warnings from spain's cnmv and australia's asic.

&amp;#x200b;

**how we outsmarted them**

after fred and i discovered all this among many other disturbing signs, we were sure he had been scammed and we needed to do something to stop these guys. here's what we did, we contacted a forex lawyer at giambrone law firm, reported the ordeal to regulatory authorities like the [financial conduct authority (fca)](https://www.fca.org.uk/), [us securities and exchange commission (sec)](https://www.sec.gov/), [australian securities and investments commission (asic)](https://asic.gov.au/), [comisión nacional del mercado de valores (cnmv)](https://www.cnmv.es/) which is the national securities market commission is the spanish government agency responsible for the financial regulation of the securities markets in spain. please note that these actions we took can only go a long way to stop the scam broker from continuing their fraudulent acts but we were determined to get back our money by all means, we had heard about firms that helped victims recover their losses and were also warned about fraudulent recovery firms. we made in-depth research on the possibilities of recovery and encountered [***paradigm cyberrecovery organization***](https://paradigmtech.org/) ***(***[***info@paradigmtech.org***](mailto:info@paradigmtech.org)***)***, we got connected with the head of their forensics team alexander wright on skype/tg, who initiated a restitution of fred's investments by the aid of  new technologically induced equipment with algorithms relative to blockchain, adequate ethical experience and professional expertise. after we were satisfied with the actions we took against umarkets in recovering our funds, fred and i did something kinda silly...lol. we used umarket's convining tactic against them, we created multiple accounts, made the first little investment of 750 on each of the accounts, received the roi and didn't make any more investments.

**so yeah, we outsmarted them big time!!!!!!!**"

"recieved a text with nasty images and threats hi, does anyone ever received a text with threats and nasty images about dead bodies? saying that i wasted the hookers time and now they want money or they will hurt my family? from what i get its a scam..."
"i fell, but not completely, for sextortion scam so this asian chic i met on okcupid added me on my ig. ok cool, she had some pics, like 20, decent amount of followers, nothing out of the ordinary. we chatted and ask for my skype, (i should have picked up it was a scam right there), we talked on skype and i fell asleep. the bitch, guy or girl whatever, called me at 1 fucking am, i didnt pick up. next day we were chatting, night comes and she starts asking me for a video call. we had the video call and you already know what went down. 

afterwards there's a video of me jerking off and starts asking for money, 900 fucking dollars. something i work hard for is my fucking money, i wasn't about to send them shit. they tried to use western union. they start posting pictures of my family member from facebook and ig threatening me, saying they'll send them the video. 

i say ""ok, gimme a moment ill go to the computer and wire you the money"". i start making everything private while they're on the line. they say ""it doesn't matter if you block me, i have a copy of all your friends"". i say ""you're good... bye"", hanged up the video. they persist and start asking for 150 now, and keep sending me pictures of friends and family. i block them on skype. now, i'm pretty comfortable with my body, so through all this im thinking ""meh its not the worst thing they send them the video, my bank account is more important than a nude video"". luckily one of the pictures they sent was my sister, so i asked her if she'd received anything, and nothing yet. i'm hoping this is over, but whatever man. 

guys privacy is fucking important, watch what you do online."
"password-protected word document scam/virus thing (probably) funny, i got a similar one of these emails at work, too. decided not to check out what virus they were harboring inside the attachment.

i appreciate the effort they put into the signature to make it especially legitimate looking.

when you receive emails like this, ask yourself:

is the ""to:"" me?

does the sender email from an even halfway-looking-legitimate domain?

do the sender and reply-to emails match?

does the sender email match emails written in the body?

is the information consistent? (the invoice number in the subject does not match the body, nor the attachment.)

the more nos you rack up, the faster you should run away.

help!!! i recently filed a claim with the law firm to get compensated for jewel addiction. i got a call tonight around 8:30 pm from somebody claiming to be the law firm that i had contacted. the lady on the phone sent me a document to sign via email and i signed it and sent it off. the document looked legit and she ran me through everything and seem to know what she was talking about. when i looked up the telephone number online it said that it was a scam and now i’m worried that i will get myself in trouble. if anyone knows how to either cancel this or make sure nothing happens to my identity i would appreciate it
"elon novac (update) so, the elon novac post here is too old to comment on, so i made a new one.

i checked their analytics on instagram using hypeauditor/social blade (although you can see and calculate this trend by just going onto their page) and they have an engagement rate of about 1% (for a brand on instagram that seems to be pretty high) and their likes to comments ratio is at 200:1 on a good day. i checked their comments to see how many were bots, and some accounts seem suspicious (there's at least one example of an account with no profile picture that consistently commented on every post) but surprisingly i saw at least two other brands in their comments consistently, which is pretty high considering most posts had less than 7 comments.

their follower gain rate is also really unstable, there's a period from august 2019-december 2019 where they'd gain a certain number of followers that week (usually in the thousands) and then lose a similar number the next week. one week they gained 10k, then the next 105 (in ones, mind you), then they lost 3k followers.

it's pretty clear something strange is going on with their followers, but i'm not sure they buy likes and such. i'm not sure what the average like-to-comment ratio is for an instagram ad. anyone else have something to add?"

"skype / facebook sextortion scam.. i paid! i fell for the skype scam where a girl added me on fb, we go to skype, things get intimate and then i get a message on fb the next day. initially i ignore the message, but the person is persistent and when i ask ‘who is this?’ they drop the entire ‘i will ruin your life / 2 minutes and i will send this video to ur entire family etc etc’, along with a list of my fb friends and families name. 

i immediately start to panic and shake as my family are very strict christians and they would totally be in complete disbelief / shock / utter disappointed in me for a very long time if this was to be sent to them. i got really scared so i tried to negotiate (1st mistake) eventually i end up sending them money (£150 to morocco through moneygram). once they got the money they told me they would delete my number (2nd mistake was giving them that) and the video. 

it’s been 8 days since this happened and since then i have done some research. reading all the posts on here i know i have made a huge mistake sending them money, as they have probably labelled me now as a target. since then i have increased my fb privacy settings, deactivated my fb, blocked / reported the fb profile / whatsapp number and set up a google alert for my name. i now expect they will come back asking for more money. if that happens i will definitely ignore all communications and hope for the best. 

i wasn’t sure if i should post this, i still get really anxious and stressed thinking about it and it’s affecting my studies / sleep a lot so please go easy on the ‘ur such an idiot for paying’ comments."

"great amazon jog offer, almost got me. hello everyone! 

i'm a sr. project manager in the job market and received a super exciting call this morning from a woman named agnes at prostaffingco.com.

the job was incredible, remote direct- hire position with amazon as a customer facing sr. pm working a project to begin technology acquisitions with the uk. 

i sent him my current resume and wrote a fantastic cover letter.  i was excited to hear back, right away, from her manager,  aaron.mendes@prostaffingco.com. he let me know he would submit my resume and conver letter to the manager and conducted a short interview with me.  basic interview questions,  raised no red flags.  

15 minutes later he called back to let me know the hiring manager loved my resume and wanted to move forward.  talk about excited!!! this is a direct hire position with amazon at 150k a year plus a 20% fixed bonus.  hell yes!

aaron let me know i would need to get my professional scrum product owner certification right away.  he sent me a great email with links for both in person and online courses that amazon recommended.  i was ready to sign up on the spot.  but...my gut told me it was too good to be true.  and it turns out... it was. 

i decided to do some digging and found the scam online right away.  bbb even listed his name,  spelled differently, but yep.  

the emails i received all looked legit.  the links looked fine, as well.  the scam involves getting you to purchase the certification course that you will never get,  and they'd run with your $499 - $699, depending on your course level you choose.  these are legitimate courses,  but not through the link.  

he almost got me,  damn, i was so excited about the opportunity and it truly matched my experience exactly. 

note to self  - always trust your gut!!! 

the triggers for me were:
1) no hiring manager reviews candidate resumes that quickly
2) no contracting / recruiting company calls you back in 10 minutes to make sure you're purchasing the course.  

there were other things during the conversation that just seemed off.  his schmoozing, building me up,  saying i was the best,  etc. i'm good,  19 years experience,  but thank goodness i listened to that little voice.   be aware folks.  and good luck!"
"phone call about sealed legal documents i received a call last night saying i need to call another number and provide a case number because someone filed a formal complaint against me. so, like a dummy, i called them. the person who answered said that i had two hours to begin a payment plan on a medical debt that i did not recognize. i pulled my credit reports from the time in question and i never had a debt with the debtor they claim i owe. 

the alarming part is they had my social security number, dob, street address, the works. probably trying to get me to confirm something. they claim they sent a debt validation letter (i’ve never talked to them before) 45 days earlier but i never received it. i requested information on the debt but they refuse saying it was too late and they were going to garnish my wages unless i started a payment plan. basically, i got transferred to a “floor manager” and he said if i didn’t start a payment plan today their “underwriting department” would finalize the arbitration process. they continued to say they’ve already completed a financial investigation against me and the debt is definitely mine. i never confirmed this and, in fact, checked my credit report (while we were on the phone) for the time in question and there was nothing there. his explanation for this is that they have the ability to remove the debt from my credit report at will and will put it back if i refuse to cooperate. i asked for something by certified mail but they said it was too late and the next step is i pay or they sue me. 

i guess my question is, does this sound like a scam or is it a legitimate company trying to sue me?"
"anyone getting the amazon services scam phone calls? i just started getting calls ( i don’t answer and let them go to voicemail) that are variants of “your service is about to be discontinued “ nature.  the voice is a robotic female.  in this case, the calls are for “amazon services”.   the message states that i need to speak to a manager to keep the service going."
"can i get someone else’s opinion of if this is a modeling scam , the website seemed very phony , and here’s the email - "
"likely legal scam involving unclaimed property recently, my wife received a very real, very official letter from a (law?) firm (something &amp; associates) sent via first class mail, indicating that she had $800 in unclaimed property that they were holding for her. they had all of her old information correct--maiden name, old address, etc. the money was from a college that she had taken a couple of classes at nearly 20 years ago. all of this made it seem like it was legitimate. in fact, i suspect that if she filled out the forms, she would have received the money.

here is the scam part. in the letter, they informed her that they could release the money to her for a 10% fee ($80). i remembered that this state (we no longer live there) has an online repository of any unclaimed property and monies, like this. so i quickly looked up my wife's name and old address on the official government website and found the unclaimed property from her old college in the exact amount specified in the letter. all she had to do was fill out some forms online and the state sent her the *full $800* without any cost to her. 

my guess is that this is a completely legal scam. this firm likely collects information on unclaimed property above a certain amount from state governments and then tracks down the owners, and then offers to get them their property for a small fee. however, my guess is that those people, like my wife, can simply collect this property without losing 10% to this middleman if they go to the state's unclaimed property office. 

so if you get a similar letter, see if you can track down this unclaimed property yourself before letting someone else do it for you."
"is this website a scam? https://toys.uitoys.com

the sales these guys have is ridiculous, too good to be true.

"if you get a blackmail e-mail that lists one of your real passwords, change every account you have that uses that password! so first off, i want to acknowledge that i’m an idiot and what happened to me was completely preventable. i just hope that i can make people aware of this if they aren’t already.
  
i’m one of those people that had used the same password for most of my accounts for years and years. i know you’re not supposed to do that, but nothing bad had every happened so i was never really concerned about it.
  
a while back, i started getting those blackmail emails that have the subject line “i know your password is: *insert password here*” and then a message about being recorded on a porn site, demanding money etc. by now we all know those emails are complete bullshit, but what isn’t bullshit is the fact that your password and email have been leaked and are on a list somewhere. 
  
shortly after, i started getting login attempts on all sorts of my accounts. i didn’t put together at first why this was happening and unfortunately i had my credit card info saved on one of the websites. i ended up having fraudulent charges on my card, my facebook hacked and posting spam, and my rewards points stolen on sites that my card wasn’t accessible on.
  
it has been a huge pain in the ass, and it’s all because i had the same password for all these sites. hackers know that a lot of people do this, and they’ll try the combo on every popular website they can think of. i’ve changed them all now. lesson learned. don’t be like me!"

"just received a sketchy phonecall, did i mess up? got a call that looked relatively local. i answered, it was an american person. convo as follows: 

caller: ""is this 'ancienteldritch'?"" 
me: ""yes."" 
caller: ""do you own real estate?"" 
me: ""no?"" 

caller immediately hung up on me. 

normally i don't answer scam calls but it caught me off guard being a non-foreign person with a local number.

"it's increasingly hard to differentiate scams from legitimate calls. i got a call from a scammer that sounded legit as hell who wanted to verify my social and send me a code to my phone to recite back.

then i called my bank from the number in their actual app, and they asked me for my mother maidens name, and i just hung up out of paranoia.

it has almost got to a point where i don't know who to trust anymore. i hear an indian accent, i hang up. i hear a filipino accent, i hang up.

my point is why don't banks verify themselves when they call you or even when you call them?"

"united nations 7 days long scam. my mother almost got involved in a 7-day long scam from a person who pretended to work for un and nato and since this scam was longer and more elaborated than any other scam i ever read about i wanted to share it with you.

the scam started on instagram when a guy, i will call alex, started to follow my mother. alex introduced himself as a nato operator in yemen and started to compliment and flirt with my mother for almost 5 days. my mother is divorced and she has been looking for a long time for a relationship and this guy seemed genuine. he has various pics on instagram and the way he talked was all gentleman and caring at the beginning. saying his wife was dead in a car accident and he has been looking for a long time to find someone to share the life with. they exchanged email adresses and phone numbers. he sent her also pics of himself. they were chatting for hours every day and even had some whatsapp voice calls. he promised marriage and that he would come to visit her very soon.

yesterday (6th day) my mother called me because she wanted help with some delivery payment to help alex retreive a package with money and documents from the united nations delivery office in uk. he could not receive the package himself since he was deployed in yemen and mail couldn't be delivered in a country where there is war.

she had received an email asking her for all her personal details and a preferred way of payment. she had already provided her adress and id information and was asking me about the 2550,00 british pounds she would need to pay for this delivery. he promised her to pay her back when he would come to visit her.

she wanted my opinion on this since this big amount had raised some flag. i really appreciate that she had the sense to smell something was not right here.

i called her today (7th day) and explainded all the situation to her. she started crying bcs she was angry for being cheated in such a way. i was personally surprised of the amount of time the scammer had invested in this scam."

"scammers are getting stupid(er) here is the typical nigerian prince letter, as posted in 5 different forums on a website i help moderate, including a thread on free dental cleanings and one on puppies for sale. the shotgun approach, i guess.

please, my sincere apology if this communication don't meet your

personal ethics. i have to contact you via this medium because i

really need to get in touch with someone as you. i anticipated that

this correspondence might come as a surprise to you because we don't

know each other before but since it is widely said that the connection

between a man and his millions is another man, i am here with a

proposition that is ordained to connect us to our destiny.

&amp;#x200b;

someone who was an investor with our bank but died years back has just

come to the limelight in opleur bank. since over ten years that he died

his portfolio and investment worth millio$2,000,000 (two million

dollars us). has not been touch because no name next-of-kin was found

in his bio-data form, now, this investment has generated an accrued

interest to the amount of 300.000 usd because he was operating a

domiciliary usd account.

&amp;#x200b;

the bank management has therefore authorized me as the director of

investment banking accounting and finance of our bank to locate any

living relative of this investor so that the funds can be paid to the

family of the late investor. this is accordance with the banking

ethics &amp; policies as stipulated by existing apex banking laws. i will

simply nominate &amp; empower you with all the relevant information(s) and

documentations to enable you claim the money smoothly.

&amp;#x200b;

if i don't do this and inform the bank i cannot locate any relative of

the investor, the funds will be revert/re-circle into the bank

treasury as unclaimed monies and people that know nothing about the

source of the funds will spend it that is the irony of the banking

industry which is purely aberrational.

2. occupation

please reply to me immediately you received this email with your most

direct telephone line and private email address so that i can call and

furnish you with all the details. please note, we shall be sharing the

money equally as i will make the atmosphere suitable and conducive for

you to successful claim the money without hitch &amp; risk-free as

beneficiary. i know you don't know the dead investor, this is great

god favor for you and me."

"am i getting scammed? backstory:  i live in a condo and a month back all the four wheels of bmw were stolen and the car was left on four jacks. a week after this incident, the rear brake pads were stolen.

while the car is at the garage, i'm using my old civic. a neighbor, who works/has a towing business, sees my civic and is interested in buying it

fast forward to now: i am looking to move out of the condo due to the incident above and the same neighbor is supposedly looking to rent my place. he cites that his current place is being sold. i check his fb profile and see that has a business of buying and selling used cars. 

while i really hope i am just being paranoid, i'm also thinking that this is too much of a coincidence. any thoughts on if this is a scam?"

"golden retriever puppy scam i feel like a fool, a big ol' dumbass. here's a little background info: my 7-year-old son has adhd, and we've been thinking about buying a dog to add another member to the family. we wanted the puppy to grow up with my son so that way my son could learn life responsibilities and to also have a companion to cope with what he's going through. we are located in elk grove, ca.

&amp;#x200b;

well, i went on craigslist and found a very cute golden retriever listed from san francisco, ca. i messaged the owner of the listing, and she responded back fairly quickly. she emailed a bunch of questions to see if my family would be suitable for this puppy. i answered everything, then a few hours goes by and she responds back saying that she think we would be great. her asking price was $850, which included adoption fee and delivery fee. she had 2 pups available, one female (rose) and one male (royal). we thought that was great because it will save us a 3-hour drive to pick up the pup. we thought we got really lucky.

&amp;#x200b;

so the seller gave me her information to send payment, through zelle. i thought ok, through the bank sounds legit. i sent her the payment at 9:30 pm, and she told me she went to register the pup to be delivered and booked a flight. i thought ok... a flight? maybe it was the way the process is done now. she then confirms that the pup is ready to fly out and i should get him by tonight. at 11:00 am i get an email from the shipping company to confirm all my information. ok, sounds good. i confirm it. then at 11:13 am i get another email from them telling me that the crate that the pup is in won't be acceptable for the pup to fly in and i would need to rent another one for $1000 and i would be refunded upon the delivery of the pup. i started to feel skeptical at this point. i asked my siblings what they thought of the situation, they were skeptical as well but we thought we'll just risk if anything i could dispute with the bank to get my money back. again, this company asked me to send payment through zelle. ok, through the bank again, no problem.

&amp;#x200b;

at 2:12 pm, i received another email from the shipping company giving me a flight status, the email said that the pup is flying from richmond, tx to albuquerque, nm. wait, what? i thought she was located in san francisco. ok, i will just go with the flow. then, at 4:23 pm i get another email from the company. this time stating that the pup is in nm, but the pet control team discovered that the pup doesn't have insurance and requires that i pay $500 which was originally $750 to get the correct paperwork to allow the pup to fly to sacramento, ca. i talked to the guy at the company and he insisted that it was nm's law. and the shipping company would refund me that money upon delivery of the pup. now i'm 100% sure i'm being scammed. i texted the seller to ask her what's going on. she said she would call the company and sort things out. 20 minutes later she texted back that the company said it's the law and i was required to pay. so now, i want to test how she responded, i asked her if she could cover it for me and i'd pay her back when i get the money. she said she only had $200. i said to her, ""i just paid you for the pup, shouldn't you have the money to cover it?"". she stopped responding. i tried calling the phone number, but it's being screened i belive because it asks for your full name to be able to get connected. and it's weird because her number is a stockton area-code number, which i also have.

&amp;#x200b;

well, i called my bank to dispute this. my bank says that it was an instant payment so they aren't able to stop it. and also, since i was the one who sent the money, there are chances that i lost all my money. all $1850.00. then, they said they will escalate the situation and send all the detail to zelle to see what can be done, and i was recommended to file a police report, which i will tomorrow morning. i will bring all the documents and show them the conversation i had with the seller.

&amp;#x200b;

i feel like utter crap. i'm usually smart about all this, i've never been scammed before. i usually look into everything before i jump. but in this situation, it was hard to do so, since it's craigslist.

&amp;#x200b;

please be careful yall.

tl;dr: tried buying a very cute golden retriever puppy and ended up getting scammed for $1850.00, and i might possibly not be able to get the money back."

"don't use autocheck.com good day all, my name is chris and i'm an insurance appraiser in the state of texas.

i was looking to purchase a 2014 dodge charger police used at a dealership. 

obviously with this being a police vehicle i wanted to get an idea of it's history, after all, it was listed at a fantastic price. 

since i had found the vehicle on autotrader, i figured i'd give their vehicle history check a try.

i was directed to autocheck.com, an arm of big credit bureau experian, ""i'm in good hands."" atleast i thought. 

the history report given by the website listed as far back as 2017, showed no accidents, and other than the latest sale record in 2017, had no service history at all. 

i decided to be cautious and ran a carfax report, possibly the most trusted name in the business, atleast the most recognizable one. 

although it ran me twice the price of the former website, carfax reported all the way back to the car's manufacture date in canada 2014. 

including the accident that wiped out the entire right side! 

tl;dr: autocheck nearly led me to buy a car by hiding a major accident that carfax showed."
"fake job turns into check cashing scam - matra s.r.l i'm in the process of applying for a lot of jobs, and i got an email from a lady about a job. didn't seem to strange, the job was remote and part time, but the company was out of italy. (red flag 1), and they were trying to pay $4k per month on a part time job (red flag 2). the company is called matra s.r.l. (s.r.l is like an italian llc)

so i play a long for a while, i talk to the lady on the phone, and she almost has me convinced that i'm getting a real part time job doing real estate research (its relevant to my field). until finally i get an email with an assignment and it goes something like this

&gt;our client is going to send you a check, you need to cash it and send us the money via western union, you get to keep 5%. it is very important that you cash the checks and send the wire transfer within 24h of receipt. . . 

so they mail me a check. i open it up, look at the fake invoice from the ""client"" and the check. i make a big rip in the envelope and tell them it was damaged in the mail. now they send another check yesterday and i say i'm traveling and i won't be able to cash it until friday (what happened to 24h being so important??).

so i want to keep wasting their time. what should i do next? my thought is to just pretend i don't know how to cash a check, but i also want to keep messing with them for as long as possible."

i’m pretty sure it was a scam, but i’m more afraid of the fact that they knew my first name. should i be worried?? what can i do? i still have the phone number."

"is change healthcare a scam? i just went through a skype text interview with someone from this healthcare technology company called change healthcare, offering a high wage for me, who lacks experience with this field for a work from home position. i got accepted for the work at home position, but something still seems very off. they said that they would fund the macbook that they would send to me and give me a check to purchase the needed equipment (which they did and it's in my bank, didn't ask for my info). 

however, i still get the feeling that something is off; the interviewer's grammar and spelling was a bit off and kept repeating questions that were already answered. i looked up the company and they got below average reviews.

"social security administration, ""your ssn has been discontinued."" i've gotten two calls today, one supposedly from san antonio, tx at about 7am and another just now, about 2:40pm supposedly from washington dc. i know it's a scam, but when i see the search results for the numbers, every other report is from today or the last few days which i'm sure is just other people doing the same as me, googling the number who's calling.

message is in a robo-woman voice,

""hello this call is an official final notice from social security administration.  the reason of this call is to inform you out department has decided to suspend your social security number and file a lawsuit against you as we have received an suspicious activity on your social. to get more information please call on our department number, (+++) +++-++++.""

"someone booked airline tickets in my name so i received an e-mail from a local carrier containing the boarding pass for an online check-in.

i thought it was an attempt at phishing, but when i verified on the official website someone had indeed been making an online checkin.

i called customer support and someone from an indian call center (it's late at night where i am) confirmed that my name and details (email and phone number) were used to book a roundtrip flight. he gave me the confirmation number which i used on the official website, and i saw that 1 flight took place yesterday. the other one is for tomorrow.

the strange thing is: this person used another credit card.

this has me concerned because i cannot understand what could be going on. so there's a person with my information using that information to book flights (and who knows what), but they don't have my cc number. what am i missing? what could be going on?

i'm contacting customer support tomorrow to speak to a local representative (the indian dude did not understand why i was concerned about receiving a boarding pass to my name to a flight i never booked)."

"is care.com a scam? whats up guys, i am a mechanical engineering student and decided to look into becoming a math tutor through [care.com](https://care.com/) . i created an account, filled out all of the required info, wrote a summary discussing teaching style and achievements and uploaded a picture. i did not purchase a membership/upgrade to premium because i was unsure if i would like it. i did not purchase the background check for $33 either. after that, i saw multiple openings and responded to all of them and have yet to get a response.

out of curiosity, i made an account for the receiving end and posted a job with requirements that best suited my profile. within a few minutes, the job showed up on my original account and i responded to it as a tutor applicant. it has been over an hour since then, and the notification that i applied has not shown up as a response for the posted job, yet the job has disappeared from view on the care giver side of things. i also noticed that my original profile will not show up on the list of available tutors in the area.

is [care.com](https://care.com/) a scam that completely suppresses caregivers that do not fork over $33 for a background check and dont pay the monthly subscription for ""premium members""? from what i can tell, it seems like it.

i understand the idea of showing paying members first when looking for tutors, but my profile wont even show up. i can only assume that all of my other applications are not showing up either."
"do legitimate debt collectors often call from spoofed numbers? the collection agency in question is h*nt*r w*rf*eld (just censored it incase names aren't allowed in this sub). 


fwiw i did recently realize i have some medical debt (&lt;$500) that's about 3 years old. i intend on calling my insurance company sometime within the next 2 weeks when i finally have the house to myself so i can sort everything out and find out if they truly sent the bill to collections.


#but ...


i don't recall when exactly these calls started arriving? i want to say this past january (maybe even december), but they've been going extra hard these past couple weeks. the calls are to my landline home phone. the call log on the phone has only logged calls since feb 10. 


and since feb 10, the collection agency has used 2 different phone numbers that had been identified by caller id with the agency's name. however, the agency has been using another number as well, which caller id identified as ""800 service"" ... i know this is the agency because the robotic voicemail message explicitly says so. 


there's been even more random numbers calling lately, that caller id identified as being from states i have no business with whatsoever. a lot of random calls supposedly from my state too. there's also been calls from a town local to where i reside, which has called with 4 different numbers, where only the last 4 digits were different. also ... at least 3 totally different phone numbers from ""wireless caller"" would repeatedly call as well. even started getting calls from ""walmart.com"" yesterday. none of the numbers mentioned in this paragraph ever left voicemail though. except i got a call from ridge md yesterday that left some voicemail about social security being involved with fraudulent activity, and we must call them back before a lawsuit of some sort happens ... this i strongly feel is an obvious scam.  


speaking of scams, maybe a week or two ago my dad picked up the phone from  ""police"" and they were asking for donations. i've yet to ask him if he ever confirmed his name/address/ssn (i hope he didn't), but he casually mentioned that we should be getting some mail soon from the police - i know we most likely aren't getting anything - thankfully my dad refused to pay over phone and just told them to mail us a bill or something. i feel like it's possible that because my dad picked up the phone and proved our number is active, these scammers have been going hard since (but maybe that's also recency bias on my end lol). 


so with all this considered, is it possible that the collection agency is not seeking out a legitimate debt, perhaps isn't even the actual collection agency and it's all a scam? 
or could it be the agency spoofing as all these random numbers trying to get us to pick up the phone?
 ***or*** are the obvious scams (ssn, police) actually totally different from the actual legitimate agency that's been reaching out to us (even with the spoofed local appearing numbers), and we're just in an unlucky period with all these spammed calls?  
what do y'all think?"

"tf2 team in tournament needing a stand in was a scam terms for those who don't know:

steam: a major computer games platform that many people have hundreds or thousands of dollars of games in a library

steam guard: two-factor authentication codes for steam

tf2: a free to play team based objective shooter (objective being like king of the hill or pushing a payload, etc)

&amp;#x200b;

girl from alaska contacted me and a day or so after i accepted her friend request (somewhat not completely a red flag) asked if i play tf2 and what characters i played - so a normal conversation about video games. then asked if i could be a stand in for a tournament that is going to be in 20 minutes. sent me a link to [zipgameit.com](https://zipgameit.com) which uses a steam log in... but it actually goes to a fake ""site has gone down for maintenance"" when you get signed up with your steam login credentials and a steam code sent to you by text. logging in normally then tells me there's an issue connecting to steam servers

the red flags i found after completely falling for it:

the site does not show up in a google search, or even talked about as far as legitimacy. all links on the page such as the ones at the bottom of all sites that include ""jobs"" and ""about us"" they're all fake links that all call on a javascript function that brings up the login with steam account prompt (which is a normal thing for legitimate sites that use steam data, but this one is just phishing) in the sign up page, the links for privacy policy and terms and conditions are just colored different and aren't actually clickable.

&amp;#x200b;

i can not change my password as i cannot receive my steam guard code anymore. some of the steps of changing my password within steam itself were having errors completing their tasks so instead, i have locked my account and contacted steam support by email."
"i think a lyft driver tried to scam me so i called lyft for a ride today..

lady shows up, when i am standing outside.

she waits a moment (as i am walking to her car) and says her phone is not working, she cannot take the ride.

she wants me to cancel and order another one.  i said if i cancel, i will get charged 10 dollars, she said no it won't charge you.

so as soon as i cancel, she drives right off.  which i found sketchy af, cause as i was looking around the ap for a undo drive request, there was none so i had to cancel.  now if the phone wasn't working, how did she know the exact moment i pressed cancel?  an hour later, i check my bank and sure enough, they charged me for canceling the ride.

i contact lyft with this info and they refund my money with no hassle.

so my main thought was that this person can show up to your pick up spot, convince you to cancel for whatever reason and drive off.  she gets a cut of the cancel money for doing nothing other than showing up to your pick up spot.  anyone else run into this sort of issue?"

i applied for jobs on indeed and a foreign film company returned my request. they're shooting in my area in the us and wanted to have me secure equipment/rental space for them. makes sense since they aren't local. 

today i received an email stating i'd get a check for 3x what i've asked for, with the remaining being to pay the vendor. i've also been told that my contact is in the states and will be attending the vendor meeting with me this weekend. we're meeting a hotel beforehand for an interview...

well, the job seemed great but now the red flags are starting to add up.

the red flags:   
\- i've never been paid before actually contributing/delivering a product.   
\- the production was supposed to be last week. i had to follow-up to confirm it wasn't, now moved to next week. communication has been less than stellar. also, filming rarely can have massive delays like this.  
\- everything has been over email.   
\- they contacted me, receiving my application through indeed. i confirmed today that i have no history of applying to this specific production company, but a different production company that matches the rates their offering. all info about that company except my application submission is wiped from indeed.   
\- i know very little about the production, only that it's a short film.    
\- the email on the contact website is slightly different than the one contacting me. (person@website.com vs [person.website@gmail.com](mailto:person.website@gmail.com))  

now the check has arrived for again 3x my rate. it's a cashier's check, from a massachusetts based bank. the package received was addressed from a cake company in texas. after i cash the check they are telling me to contact an email account and text an la based number.

also, all these instructions are in comic sans. yikes.

i've sent them nothing but address/cell/emergency contact info so i'm unsure what exactly the scam is here.   
i'm refraining from cashing the check till i get more info from the initial contact but if anyone has seen something like this or has advice, it'd be helpful. thanks."

"why don't police care about scammers??? **tldr;**  ***friend got call from jc penny in another state, someone was trying to open an account in his name, john called police to arrest the guy, police refused to do it.***

\* \* \*\* \*\* \*\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*\* \* \*\* \*\* \*\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*\* \*\* \*\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*\* \*\* \*\* \* \* \* \* \* \* 

i have a friend named john, john has to check his credit twice a week because scammers have gotten a hold of his ssn and personal info (his wallet got stolen two years ago) and they open up credit cards in his name on a weekly/monthly  basis.  he (via his credit card companies) is scammed $200k to $300k per year.  

fwiw, john has amazingly good credit which makes it easier for the scammers to open credit cards in his name.

so, its 2003 in texas, we are at work, and john gets a call from a  jc penney in michigan.  the michigan clerk was processing john's new application for a $7k credit limit and the system approved it but the clerk felt something was wrong... luckily, john has a jc penny credit card and it lists his address in texas and john ""just"" used his jc penny credit card the other day in texas...

however, this new ""john"" put down that he lives in michigan... so the clerk put two and two together, looked up john's number in their system and gave john a call...

john is on the phone and says, ""wait a minute, you mean right now there is someone claiming to be me with my id in your store and you are about to give him a $7k credit limit on my account?""

clerk says, ""yes sir, he has your id and ssn card and we are about to approve him but now we will tell him to get lost.""  


john says, ""no, no don't do that, hold him there for as long as you can, what is he wearing, what part of the store exactly is he in...""

john then says, ""thanks, keep him there, tell him your system needs an hour to process and he will be approved!""

then john looks up the city police and says, ""hi, my name is john, i'm a victim of identity theft, every year, people steal $100s of thousands from me.  well, one of them is in jc penny right now with my id and he is trying to open an account for $7k in the jc penny down the street from you....  he's wearing blah-blah-blah the clerk is keeping him busy, go arrest him...""

""wait, what do you mean it's not your department, you are the police, he has my information and he is trying to open up $7k in my name and steal from me...""

""what do you mean you can't do anything about that?  you are the effing police, he is stealing my credit.  what do you mean this is the secret service's department and the check fraud department and not your department.  you. are. the. police!  he is stealing from me right now.  go arrest him!""

""wait, what do you mean it's not a crime against me?  wait what?  you mean jc penny has to call you to report the crime after he steals from them???   wait what?  look, just transfer me to your check fraud department then...

\*five minutes later\*

\*john is screaming\* 

""why can't you arrest him?  what?  he is stealing from me.  he has my id!  he is at the store right now!!!  why won't you get him.  well then who?  the fbi?  are you fucking serious?  you guys will bust into a house in full riot gear and throw stun grenades just to arrest some kids smoking $100 worth of pot but you won't go arrest this guy who is stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from me every year?  what?  what do you mean the credit card company has to call and that i can't call.  it. is. my. credit!  he is trying to open it in my name and he is right fucking there in the store right now.  it is literally 3 miles down the road from you.  fine.  all call back with the credit card company on the line.

\*30 minutes later\*

\*john is screaming\*

you guys said my credit card company has to report it, now they are on the line with me and now you still won't get this guy.  he is still at the store.  what?   the fbi?  the secret service handles this?  are you fucking kidding me!!!!  hold on, i got a call, it's from the jc penny...   ""hi... ... the guy is getting antsy... tell him it will just be 10 more minutes...""    ""look, the guy is gonna leave, now are you gonna go arrest him are what?  no?  no!!!!   jesus f christ!!!!   are you fucking kidding me!

\* \* \*\* \*\* \*\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*\* \*\* \*\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*\* \*\* \*\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*\* \*\* \*\* \* \* \* \* \* \* 

the above really happened, i personally witnessed the conversation and my friend was so livid he was beet red, veins literally throbbing in his neck and forehead....

this begs the question.  why don't police care about scammers?  setting up a sting would be ridiculously easy.  for shits and giggles i did it once to see if i could track a scammer down.  i did.  not only was it easy, it was fun.  in the process the scammer broke all kinds of federal laws, mailing me fake checks from out of state, etc.  i gave all this info to the police and they just didn't care."

"my elderly mom got scammed by an ""irish traveller"" (nc) for driveway repair. she paid $1500 cash for a $100 sealant job. recourse? as the title states, elderly mom got taken advantage of by ""nice guys"" who would do 2inches of alphalt and sealant on her 600sqft driveway for $1500. if youbarent aware of a ""travelling irishman scam"" scroll to the link at the bottom. 

mom of course thought it was a great deal since the driveway was cracked and in need of repaving. so the guys quickly showed up and sealed her driveway. used a $20 5gallon bucket of sealant from homedepot. 3hrs max. did a shit job too. 

she complained to us (adults kids) after they left. they actually gave her a reciept. address checks out to be a drug store in a strip mall. reciept is misspelled as if written by a 4th grader. clearly states ""asphalt and sealant on driveway"" for $1500. 

i estimated the 3hr sealant job they did, maybe would have come out to $300-$400s. what can i sue for? how can i sue for it if they are scammers? can i get the police involved on what may be just a civil case? seeking recourse and advice.

we called and complained (they actually answered). they said they would come by tomorrow and touch things up. i have a feeling they actually may. 

advice needed, but please keep the ""never trust a contractor or pay up front etc.etc.etc. advice"" to a minimim - i used to run a landscaping company and my brother is a contractor. we are aware of the blatant red flags. this post is for seeking legal/recourse advice.

"help i am in the sneaker reselling business, essentially i find good deals for hyped shoes (yeezys, jordan’s etc) and i had a deal with this guy, i was selling him two pairs of my yeezys for one pair of yeezys of his, a supreme hoodie and $400 cash, we shipped our items at the same time so there was no funny business. but today when i got the items he shipped me , he sent me some towels, now i lost my shoes and i’m out a lot of money, i have his address, possible name (probably fake) and proof he agreed to do the trade. what can i do? can the police do anything?"
"i keep getting this email, same wording, but from different names. what kind of scam is this? "
"i just said yes and they hung up they asked if it was me, they said “is this (name)?” it was a fake name i had given in case of identity theft, but just wondering if i should dj anything or what the next step is, if any."
"amazon mystery packages my coworker told me today he has been receiving random packages from amazon. apparently this started a few months back. originally he received some kind of baby head cover thing unexpectedly. he called amazon and they said it must be some kind of accident and they essentially didn't care and said don't worry about it. this item nor any of the other items upcoming show up in his shopping history or are in any other way tied to his amazon account.

&amp;#x200b;

since the original item has has received more including some poles designed to stick in the ground and hold up lights (like for a party in your back yard), a purple dildo, an adult onezie, a remote controlled dog training collar, a bluetooth stylus for an ipad, and a couple of other items. apparently these arrive every few weeks or so.

&amp;#x200b;

all of the packages are addressed to him, at his home address. all of the items are from different sellers. all of the items are priced around 30 bucks. total value is probably over 300 now.

has anyone ever heard of this or have any clue wtf could be going on with this?"
"craigslist contact info on listing looks weird, just wanted to get a second opinion from y'all. started looking for new apartments recently and keep coming across listings that will list their email in the description but its always something like: 'email jeff at premium7008 at gee mail dot com'. 

thats definitely a scam right? on some listings it's not even a 'too-good-to-be-true' situation but then they only list their email like that and it looks off to me. 

thanks!"
"wwardrobe site scam this place is dangerous it stinks scam all over. google took me there because i was looking for a sewing machine. it had one for $49.99 which is usually worth between $100.00 to $130.00 so i figure ok let's do it. to begin with, i didn't read that it was in china because the seller's name was brian jones. there are no brians in the hills of china selling anything that was deception one. i used pay pal and completed the transaction and i got a receipt with a bogus number. i copied and waited for email confirmation. never came. i went back to the site and couldn't make an account or log in. it kept telling me that every email i put was already there which was false. the next day i have to contact pay pal and have overridden the transaction and rescue my money.   i look on the net about that place and rea the word scam and scammers all the time. stay away from there. besides, there is nothing coming from china because of the health crisis there."
"artech information systems staffing company  i have recently been applying for a new position in my field. i received a call from someone who seemed to be offering me a legitimate role at kaiser permanente. the role is specific to what i specialize in so i was quiet comfortable at first. he was from a staffing company artech systems and had a indian accent. the part where i became suspicious was the actual conversation about the job. it’s hard to explain but what i do is a particular kind of auditing specific to regulatory compliance and it’s impossible to interview someone at all without asking specific questions. he did not ask me any questions that had anything to do with my field and did not try to narrow down my actual line of auditing work. i very concerned about the lack of questions i was even more concerned that he offered me a salary figure over the phone which is simply not done in my field. i was not at all planning to move forward, but the email he sent me…smh…

asked me for my name, my social, my address and that’s pretty much it. didn’t ask a single question about my experience or anything related to work. just needed my social… i do know kaiser asks for socials in order to apply to their jobs but ugh…. i have received an email from them requesting my social once a day for the last two weeks, no legitimate company would still be fishing for my social weeks after  the initial interview. surely the job offered isnt even available."

is this a scam? i went to change my password (not clicking the link. i actually when on google to get the microsoft website) not sure what to do 
need help with a potential scam so i have a question about a potential scam and i can't work out what happened or what the angle is. my mother has a walmart account she rarely uses but had a saved credit card in. the other day she gets an alert that someone ordered two google play digital codes and a physical item which she had in cart from christmas. they then cancelled the physical item. the play cards came to her email address. the strangest part is they bypassed her saved card and put in a new saved card with her name. this card has a non real address in a different state but a real road. i checked her credit karma and life lock and she no new cards on her account or credit checks from a credit card company. none of her other cards have new charges. i've been racking my brain on this and can't figure it out. i changed the password on the walmart account and deleted the real card. i haven't touched the google play digital codes. i was going to return those but i don't know how to check if they were used without activating them. is this a scam or just a strange error. thanks for the insight.

"potential check scam? i'm a 19 year old college student looking to get a part time job, and i recently accepted an job offer off of ziprecruiter from a real estate company in italy. i've never searched for a job online so i'm not exactly familiar with all the scams, but this felt fishy just because it was an out-of-country company. i went through with it because they didn't ask for any personal information and i read through the job offer/description they sent me, and there were no red flags. 

however, the second assignment i received from my ""job"" involves ""customer invoice processing,"" in which a customer of the company receives an invoice and they send the payment to me. from that point, i am supposed to cash the check into my own banking account, then i keep my 5% remuneration from the invoice and inform my supervisor that i successfully cashed the check. from that point i'm supposed to wire the money to either a us supervisor or directly to italy.

to me, this seems like one of those secret shopper scams and i am trying to get in contact with my supervisor now. until then, what do you guys think?"

however there are few red flags. firstly, some dresses are cheap (below 100 pounds). however they still have dresses, which cost 300-500 pounds... secondly, there is nothing about this website on trustpilot. thirdly there is a custom size.

"having fun with a car scammer back in 2009, i'm on craigslist looking for a car when i come across a 2015 bmw, nice, blue book lists it around $13k but this guy is selling it for $3k...

and of the course the pic is awesome...

i call him up, and his english is horrible, he talks about how this is a good deal and he is only selling it to someone he trusts because he needs the money asap because his kid needs an operation or something.  he can't provide me a vin because the car is in storage.  i ask to see the car and he says that the car is in florida and he can ship it to me for $500.  so he is actually taking a loss selling this car but it's okay because he trusts me...

so, all i have to do is wire him $3k via western union and he will ship the car from florida.  i ask him the address and name of the shipping company and he provides it.  then i tell him that i have a business trip to florida and that i will be in the city that the shipping company has the car.  so i say i'll just pick the car up there and drive it back myself.  but he says, no, the car has to be shipped. 

i keep poking holes in the story, what is the number of the shipping company, the address, why can't i pick it up if i'm going to be in florida...

his lies get more outlandish and now he starts getting angry at me.  he starts yelling, ""i thought i could trust you.  i'm giving you such a good deal...""   

then i say just to mess with him, ""fine, how about i wire you $1k right now so you know you can trust me, and then when i fly to florida and see the car i'll wire you the rest and then you can ship the car to me.""

he immediately gets happy and is my friend again.  he gives me all the information i need to western union him the money.

so, i set up a western union to fl for $1 but then i don't give him the proper confirmation number.  so when he calls, wu says, ""you have a payment, enter confirmation number"" but if you enter the wrong confirmation number wu is not allowed to tell you any details of the wire, only that you have a pending wire.

i string him along for one week like this, constantly giving him stories and wrong numbers and seeing how many hoops i can make him jump through

i take all his info and i put in on various websites so that if anyone searches for it it pops up.  i even created a yelp review of him detailing the scam...

lastly, i send everything i compiled on this guy to the police, but unfortunately, they really didn't care (which was very disappointing)"
"social security number call. scam? hey, my parent gave away my ssn over the phone. i wasn't able to stop it but i have my suspicions it was a scam call. apparently, they called because they had my ssn wrong so they wanted to know it was and called my parent to get it. also, it looked like they used another phone number when they wanted to hear what the ssn was (they switched to another). all inferences from what i heard over the phone but my ssn was definitely given. it was for ""tax"".

what should i do if it's a scam call?"

final warning!
you have 46 hours in order to make the payment. (i have a facebook pixel in this email, and at this moment i know that you have read through this email message). if i do not get the bitcoin, i will certainly send out your files and video recording to all your contacts including relatives, coworkers and all contacts. having said that, if i receive the payment, i'll destroy all files and videos immediately. if you need evidence, reply with ""yes"" and i will certainly send out your video recording to your 6 contacts. it is a non-negotiable offer, don't waste my personal time and your by responding to this message.

 

i'm a hacker who cracked your devices. i set up a malware on the adult video (p0rn) website and guess what, you visited this site to have fun (you know what i mean). while you were watching videos, your internet browser started out functioning as an ""hrdp"" hidden remote desktop protocol which gave me accessibility to your screen and web camera. after that, my software program obtained all your contacts and files.

 

what did i do?
i generated a backup of your every system (private document files, video, photos, all files). i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were watching (you've got a good taste hahaha), and 2nd part shows the recording of your webcam. all your data is already uploaded to a remote server. do not try to contact me. various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either since your data is already on a remote server.

 

exactly what should you do?
well, in my opinion, 500 (usd) dollars is a fair price for our little secret. you'll make the payment by bitcoin (search ""bitcoin wallet"" in application store then download and install it) make a deposit to your wallet. after that, transfer it to my wallet.

&gt;  
&gt;so the case was brought to my office in a view to cancel your fund and divert it into government treasuries account, because of your sudden silence to comply with delivery terms and conditions. then, i asked what are the conditions but i was told that you are been required to pay the delivery charges and paperwork cost $100 but i told him to wait because there is no need to cancel the payment that i will do my very possible best to bring the issue to conclusion since it has been brought to my office.  
&gt;

"this is a scam, right? just wanna make sure "
"potential child pornography scam? hey there, i’m new to posting on reddit and this is gonna be long but i’m scared and am seeking advice. i’m a 20m and regularly frequent dating sites. i matched with a trans woman (i have no judgement over these sorts of things) and she asked for my number and i stupidly gave it to her, we were engaging in small talk and out of the blue she started sending me nude photographs that i did not ask for or reciprocate (this is important for later) she said she was new to the area and that she was of age (even though her profile listed a different age which was a red flag in hindsight) so on and so forth i agreed i would meet her for a hookup but never actually proceeded, realizing even if she was of age it was morally and ethically wrong to meet with someone that young, so i blocked and deleted the number/messages. 

the next day i receive a voicemail from a detective who did not identify himself(another red flag i’m sure), stating that allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor had been brought up against me including child pornography, solicitation, intent and all sorts of other things, he also then told me that the father of the child had left his number in case i wanted to speak with him in case it was a big misunderstanding, which it was, had i known any individual i’ve ever talked to in this manner was under age i would’ve immediately blocked all contact. 

so eventually i get in touch with the “father” who tells me that they’d rather not go to court and instead i pay for half of a therapy bill for the child (why this incident would require therapy is beyond me?) at this point i’m completely freaking out (i have an anxiety/panic disorder) eventually out of fear i agree to a payment plan situation until i pay off the half the bill, but after talking to a few people and doing some research it seems i might’ve been scammed, but being the nervous wreck i am i’m still worried it may be a legitimate legal matter, and was hoping to gain some of your insight on the matter.

important details: the cop that left a voicemail never left a name or asked me to come in (called from the local police department so possibly spoofed)

this supposed family just moved here from texas but both of their respective phones had local area codes.

i was sent an invoice for the therapy bill (although it’s quite low resolution, possibly photoshopped)

the photographs i received (and never asked for or reciprocated) were taken with an iphone but my imessage determined they weren’t from an iphone (given they were green instead of blue)

the cop who left a voicemail listed off multiple details that never happened in my conversation with this individual.

sorry for the length i’m just still unsure of what i should do next, any responses are deeply appreciated."
"18th street gang is a great scam!!! 18th street site is a great scam !!! [http://h4gca3vb6v37awux.onion](http://h4gca3vb6v37awux.onion) they promise to fulfill your order and nothing happens. you will wait a very long time and will not get anything !! they always find a reason to talk about failure. when you want to return the money, you will also wait for an excellent period and you will not receive anything. i got into this scam and lost quite a lot of money! don't send them money ever! in addition, these guys suggest you use the dark locker “external escrow” [http://escrowytu7s7rlqn.onion/](http://escrowytu7s7rlqn.onion/) and, of course, this is fraud, as you understand."
"akioka pets instagram “scam” so i run a pet account for my kitten milo on instagram. there’s been these accounts lately with the username @akioka_xxx (x being a name). they basically comment on pet people’s account wanting them to “ambassador” for @akioka_pets. i got such a comment from the account @kaye_akioka. i emailed them just to check it out, and they replied saying that to become an ambassador i needed to purchase some products and “sponsor” those products on my page. it all seemed pretty legit (i’m very cautious of scammers) and then i looked at their products. everything seemed way overpriced (even with my “50%” discount) and i found the same exact products (picture and everything) for 1/4 of the price on amazon. none of the products have the same aesthetic either, so this isn’t a “boutique.” the items are most likely made and sweatshops and them ripped off from the actual price. when i went to their page though, they had 84k followers and many of the reputable accounts i’d followed were “ambassadors” for them (although they had to buy their own products). we’re they just falling into the overpriced scam as well? like i’m not going to spend $40 on a cat sweater that’s $10.99 on amazon. i don’t know if they’re buying straight from the manufacture and selling for unreputable prices or what. the normally brand name $160 wifi treat communicator was being sold as a generic for $399?! i’m just not sure what’s going on here and want to get to the bottom of this."

"prosecutors: 22-year-old youtuber from south jersey scammed social media followers, businesses out of $1.5 million in fraud scheme a 22-year-old south jersey youtuber is accused of orchestrating a $1.5 million fraud scheme. authorities say she pulled it off by using social media to find her victims.

kayla massa has a huge social media presence with more than 300,000 instagram followers.

prosecutors believe she preyed on dozens of her followers to scam them out of thousands of dollars each.

in one of her videos, massa tells her 100,000 youtube followers how to make money selling used clothing.

but federal prosecutors say massa had a much more lucrative scheme that involved posting on instagram to lure victims.

one post reads: “if you’re from south jersey, have a bank account and trying to make some quick easy money, direct message me.”

once massa received the bank account info from a victim, she said she’d pay them a few hundred dollars.

instead, authorities say massa blocked the victims online while she deposited bogus checks made in the names of real businesses and then quickly withdrew the cash.

one of the businesses targeted was factory tune auto repairs in monroe township. don ford exclusively showed eyewitness news the counterfeit checks made out in its name.

“they don’t look anything like my check,” ford said. “i was shocked because one of them wasn’t even signed.”

factory tune lost $15,000 in the scheme but was later able to recover that money.

other businesses ripped off include joel’s auto technology in glassboro, goodie’s automotive in woodbury heights, woodbury nissan and nissan of turnersville.

authorities say, in all, $1.5 million was taken from individuals and businesses over a year-and-a-half.

“it’s an old-fashioned money scheme. it’s not technology. it’s someone made up false checks and passed them along,” ford said.

officials also say massa and nine accomplices bought expensive clothing and luxury vehicles with the money and bragged about the purchases online.

authorities say all defendants appeared in court last week.

"a microsoft scammer made me realize that there might be something wrong with me just to give some context to the story, i am a 28 year old woman who is married to another woman. sorry for the long post, but there's a tldr on the bottom of the page.

last year, during a national holiday in my country i was called up by a microsoft scammer. the call went something like this:

scammer: ""hello, i am calling from the microsoft support center, i am afraid there is something wrong with your computer.""
me: ""that's strange, i don't have a computer."" (this is actually true, i use my wife's mac)
scammer: ""what about your parents' computer?""
me: ""i don't live with my parents.""
scammer: ""what about your husband's computer?""
me: ""i don't have a husband""
scammer: ""how old are you?""
me: ""28 years old""
scammer: ""what is wrong with you? you are 28 years old and don't live with your parents and don have a husband...""

at this point i start laughing, because i have never thought about my situation that way before.

scammer: ""oh i get it, you are lying to me! you have a computer... you are living with your boyfriend.. ""
me: ""no, i actually do not have a computer. i don't need one since i often use my work computer""
scammer: ""i can fix your work computer""
me: ""i am not at work... it's a public holiday in my country.""

then he hung up on me. 

tldr; a microsoft scammer made me realize that there might be something wrong with me, since i am 28 years old, don't have a husband, don't live with my parents and don't go to work on public holidays."
"is the mschf box a scam? there's a newer ""company"" called mschf that uses sensationalism and viral marketing to push unique, and if nothing else, random, products. their latest idea, launching in a week, is a mystery box that could contain a worthless item or something up to 7k. the box costs $100 and appreciates in value (if unopened) $10/day up to $1000 and can be mailed back for money. 
mschf sent two boxes to the youtube channel unbox therapy for a review have established themselves as a seemingly-legitimate company thus far. they've even been covered in a recent ny times article. even though they're valued at over 11 million through venture capital i still don't see how this is profitable for them. 
even if one in ten box purchasers waited the whole time and redeemed the box they'd still only break even, and that's assuming one of those ten doesn't include something of value. they run the risk of a 900% loss with every package which makes me think this is a scam of sorts, similar to startup companies that take crowdfunding and leave. any thoughts? thanks!"

"solar scam i was scammed by a solar rep who claimed his company provided “no cost solar”. he told me i would pay nothing, my bill would be reduced by half, and the rest of the energy produced paid for the cost. it sounded great! i signed. come to find out, the day after it was installed, that i owe $43,500 on a loan! i’m trying to get out of it now. i’m a survivor of the butte county camp fire, still recuperating. the contract was in tiny print, too small to see on my cell phone. many things seem illegal about this. my husband did not sign although he owns 1/2 the house, and his retirement income is our only income. my friend was in the other room &amp; heard the guy. he never mentioned the word loan or $43,500. do i have to sue to get out of this contract? 

every party involved (solar company, construction company, finance company) gets 1-star ratings with comments like “scammers!” and “liars!” the comments for the solar company actually say ‘they says it’s free but it’s not’.  can i do anything to get out of this?"

so today, i was on the website free chat now, which for those of you who don’t know is an adult website. met a girl, started chatting, got her number and sent a text to her-mistake#1 right here. 

she sent some pics, and seemed to be attractive. she uses/used the tinder activation code scan that i was semi-familiar with, but horny me didn’t seem to notice. i sent her the code, and she asked for a cock pic. so i sent one. then she sent a nude, and i’m presuming, blocked me. 

what should i be concerned about? i don’t have tinder, not any other social media except reddit, which is in no way connected to me irl. what is at risk??? 

can someone give me some help please, i’m getting worried."

"weird movie texts hey folks, got a weird one for you, wondering if it's come up for anyone else? 

my phone number is oddly simple. for an example that is not my number and i'm sorry if it's anyone's: 212 - 243- 2468. i've recieved prank calls from children (hilarious, btw), and wrong numbers all the time. 

so the first text message didn't ring any alarm bells for me.

&gt;heeey it's sarah
i talked to u about coming to the movie on the 21st already but i wanted to text u just to make sure to leave me a spot to drive me. 
thx sooo much btw 😊

seems normal enough. i've sent texts like that to friends of friends i met at parties, and even got a wrong number once. i'm desperate for human contact, so i replied, trying to be pleasant. i wasn't surprised when she didn't text back. 

i left it alone, and forgot about it. then today: 

&gt; hey! my name is katarina, idk if you remember me haha.. but i wanted to ask if you were still planning on seeing the red sea miracle movie on friday and if so, could i go?

&gt; oh wait i meant tomorrow 😂

"gg got scammed by a sex worker... said £60 for three hours. then an extra £15 for the night. my first mistake. then there was a “complication” with the manager so had to pay up to £100. should’ve stopppppoed. then asked for insurance in case anything happens to her which i’ll get back. of £50 so i thought ok that sounds reasonable to some extent. bear in mind i’m straight up stupid. then when i go to pay it’s now £75. for no apparent reason. let’s just say the insurance kept going up and was demand more or she would turn around when she was 5 mins away.

"i think i’m in the middle of a scam a couple of weeks ago, someone contacted me by text offering me a job, all i would have to do is post ads on indeed.ca and they would pay me for it. well, being desperately strapped for cash, i accepted their offer, not totally thinking it through. fast forward to today, and the guy that contacted me, sent me a check and told me to cash it via a mobile bank app (just take a picture of it sort of thing). he told me the money was for a prepaid credit card minus my compensation, in order to post sponsored ads on indeed. i’ve deposited the funds, but the bank is holding the majority of the money. i told him about my situation. he instructed me to go to an atm, and withdraw a certain amount, tell him about it, and await further instructions. at that point, i had a feeling that i was being fleeced. i’m lost and i don’t know what to do."
"escort pimp threat so like an idiot i called an escort with little of no intention of going thru with it, more out of curiosity due to the pics and her service and rate, window shopping.

she asked when i’d be available if i went and i told her in a few hours, and that i’d call her if i went.

hours, about 3 hours pass and then i get a phone call from a spanish guy with broken english threatening me. at first i thought they guy had the wrong number but then when i asked what this was all about, he said for wasting the girls time. as if i had set up the appt. 

i then get a few more texts, him telling me i have to pay $200, and he sends a pic of a bunch of credit unions to process the money thru, even suggested cash app. i quickly blocked this number, then shortly i get texts from another number with pictures of people who had been mutilated by cartels. as if they’d do that over $200, but then again they’re pimps of an escort that charges $100.

i block both numbers and then i get hit up thru whatsapp, from a different number. i googled all three numbers and the first two that had contacted me i couldn’t find info on, the third, the one that had contacted me from whatsapp had listing posted as an escort.

either way i block all three numbers. point of this post is to ask the following:

1.) what’s the most someone can do with your phone number aside from harass you with calls and texts and get your house swatted?

2.) is there any way for them to acquire my identity or address just from having my phone number?

3.) ihavent received anymore calls and texts in the last couple hours but if this continues, and i receive texts from various phones, should i go to the police, tell me folks, or just pay $15 and change my number?"

"best buy purchase confirmation phonecall? i purchased a little over a thousand dollars worth of equiptment from best buy via their website and since it was all in my local store i set it to store pickup. i made my order before the store was open so i figured it would take some time. 

about 2 hours later i received a call from an out of state number and the caller said they were from best buy and wanted to confirm my purchase. i told him that it was okay because i would just do all that at the store and he told me it would be easy to just do it now. he knew what time i made my order and began listing off all if the items i purchased. i again told him i would take care of it at the store and he replied ""so you don't want to just take care of it now?"" after saying no again he then asked if he could at least confirm my e-mail to which i replied i would do that at the store too and told him to have a nice day. 

was i being paranoid or was the situation suspicious? i know that the actual store here in hawaii usually calls if there are any questions, but i don't know if that is alwaus the case. if it wasn't legit how could he have known everything i purchased?"

"possible scam hello guys,

i am afraid of a possbile scam because 3 weeks ago i was on livu app(a mobile videochat app) and talked to random people. the issue is that with one of the girl i talked dirty and i showed my body(not both face and intimate part on the same time). as far as i have seen they get money if they are called or if they receive gifts from other users. 

as far as i have checked, the app does not allow screenshots during a videocall(i tried with multiple phones), the girl did not ask for my phone number or  other social media account(skype, fb, insta,snap) they usually say that they talk only on that app, probably for money. i was not threatened that i have been recorded or smth like this and this happened 3 weeks ago. the only issue may be the fact that my nickname was my first name which is not an unique name but not very very mainstream and i am scared that may search the whole facebook and try to identify someone who looks like me.

i know i was stupid, i did not realise at that moment but last week i read an article about skype scam and i became scared. 

what do you think guys?"
"death threat text and phone call scam ""escorts &amp; pimps"" so, i've been doing tons of research on these death threat scams going around. specifically the scams that involve someone trying to hire an escort and horrible pictures along with personal information start pouring in. some pictures are even of family members that have been taken off of facebook.

there are tons of news articles all around the nation that describe this scam (each one is a little different than the last). at least i hope it is a scam, because the people performing the scam sure do make it seem real.

any ways, not only are there tons of news articles about this, there are also tons of posts on r/scams about it as well. there are also sites that list the scammer's number (findpeople and whitepage type sites) that was used, with victims from all over the country discussing the horrible texts / calls (coming from the same number). 

i also see that most victims are told to send money to the dominican republic. 

question 1: if they are told to send money to the dr, does that mean the scammer is in the dr, or is the scammer just using the dr as a way to make the money transfer less traceable?

question 2: some of these scammers claim to be a part of drug cartels and others do not mention any affiliation with any cartels. so, what is up with that? are some really a part of cartels and some aren't? or are they all bluffing no matter what they say?"

"a form of personal info theft? or am i just being paranoid? i saw something really weird today and was wondering if anyone else has ever encountered this. am i just being paranoid or is this a form of personal info theft? 

i was on a crowded public bus this morning. it wasn’t packed like sardines, but you have maybe 6 inches or so of personal space. i was standing in the middle of the carriage and scrolling through my twitter feed when i saw from my peripheral that the guy standing next to me was secretly taking pictures of the woman standing across from him. he wasn’t taking a picture of her face. he was taking pictures of the contents on her phone. as she was scrolling and reading her phone, he was zooming in on the content and snapping pictures with his phone.  he took 3 or 4 in a matter of seconds. at first i thought maybe they know each other, but then i realized he was doing it secretly. they didn’t interact at all. he was swapping between the camera app and a news app while looking around to see if anyone is looking at him. we made eye contact at one point and he proceeded to swap to the news app. i was weirded out by what he was doing so i continued to watch him through my peripheral. i admit, me watching him is kind of creepy too. after about 2 minutes, he started to take picture again and this time he started sending the pictures on whatsapp. i was really weirded out at this point so i turned to him and said loudly “excuse me, do you know this woman across from you?” he seems really flustered and said “no no i don’t.”. the woman looked up and had a puzzled look. i then asked “ then why are you taking pictures of her and what’s on her phone?” he quickly said “oh i was just interested” and then immediately moved to the back of the bus and got off because by this point the bus pulled up to a stop. the woman at this point asked me what’s going on so i told her i saw him taking pictures of what was on her phone as she was reading, the context. she seemed confused and then had to run because it was her stop too. 

am i just being paranoid? is this a case of personal information theft? has anyone else encountered this? should i have just minded my own business?"

"i caught a nigerian scammer today i opened an instagram account recently and was immediately flooded with messages from scam accounts. as i do, i mess with them and usually give them fake steam cards with no redeemable value because it's hilarious to me to scam the scammers. today, i finally got one to video chat with me, and as i suspected, nigerian. (i'm an english teacher, and i've taught many esl students from around the world, so i often recognize non-native u.s. speech patterns, especially in writing.)

she was a younger woman from nigeria living in a tall building that wasn't super well maintained, and when i asked her age, she blocked me. on the one hand, i feel bad for her. but on the other hand, she is lying and cheating men for money. so i don't feel super bad.

i wish i could've recorded the video call because i don't think i'll ever get another scammer to break character like that again."

"interesting fraud.. hi all,

not sure if theres a better place to post this but i found it interesting. over the weekend a $300 charge at a sprint store several states away appeared on my credit card. i called the store, and they said that they have been getting calls from all over the country. seems like a hacker stole credit card data from somewhere and created these ""fake"" transactions, all using that store - while it seems no one has actually walked into the store to make a purchase. 

i don't use my card on sketchy websites and whatnot, nor am i one to fall for a scam. i've taken the necessary steps already and it should be an easy dispute. just thought y'all might be interested. check your statements!"
"smartshopcentral.com this website is a scam. saw something on twitter for your car that looked cool so i clicked the link and shopped around the website for a bit. the website looked perfectly normal and the checkout service they use was even a familiar one that i have used on other websites. they had a sale buy 2 get 1 free so i bought 2 of them. my total was like $23 plus regular shipping (3-5 business days). i bought it on january 23rd. on february 2nd i got an email saying my order has been shipped, already past the 5 days. package never arrived so on february 13th i sent an email asking for an update on where my package was. no reply. tried to go on the website and got a message saying the website could not be reached. i just went onto twitter and searched “smartshopcentral” and found a bunch of people tweeting links to gadgets from the website and after scrolling i found a couple tweets of people saying they bought something from the website and it never came, emailed customer service with no reply. i’m assuming the people tweeting the links get paid to do so. you buy your fun tech toy and never see it. do not ever buy anything from them."

"crazy remote media. do nooot sign up with them. scam! this is to warn all people who may want to join crazy remote media to make ""$100 a month"". i joined about 2 months ago with their representative ""chelsea"". after allowing them to access my facebook ads account, which i thought would be okay based on reviews of the company online, i started to notice what was being posted. while they'll tell you its just recipes, you need to have a closer look at the actual trash that is being sent through your account. for example, mine featured diet pills, keto bullshit diets, etc. which is not only disgusting but not what i signed up for. i was set to be paid at the end of my first month and if you didn't guess yet, i did not. after contacting the rep, i was told it would be sent off to an ""accounting team"" and i would get a response in 48 hours. which, you guessed it, was also bs. after countless emails to get the money i signed up for, i did not get any responses. after that i decided to f\*\*\* with their sh\*\*. i disabled all of their ads, told them to terminate my contract, and took them off my fb ads account. oh but it doesn't end there! because of the disgusting content they were posting through my fb ads, my facebook business account was banned :):):) do not, i repeat do not sign up with this company. they are the biggest scammers you will ever come in contact with. if this isn't enough to turn you off from this company, they have set their own comment section on their social media pages to block words like ""scam or scammers"", leaving only filtered comments. i am certain i am not the only person that has been scammed but there will be no way of knowing it by going on their page so if this helps at least one person debating on signing up with this trash scam company, i have done my job."

"new uber driver account phishing scam hey guys, i just ran into a brand new scam tonight while driving in arizona and i wanted to spread the word so no one falls for it.

basically it's a clever phishing attemp t to get you to text your login email and password so someone can empty out your uber earnings for the week.

this happened on a sunday night which is right before the direct deposit goes out so expect to see this on a late weekend night if someone attempts it for the biggest payout.

you'll get a call to a location and once you arrive you'll get a message from the passenger asking or telling you to call them. when you call they will say they're with uber account support or security and claim that there have been reports in your area from passengers that on our authorized persons are driving vehicles in accounts that are not their own.

they will ask you to go offline and verify details from within your app and they will call you back on your phone number once they have ""verified"" it.

there is most likely someone within visual range because they have certain details like your cars make and model and your license plate number (not to mention that someone ordered the ride so unless it was location spoofed it was some nearby.)

they sound official but if you question them on anything as far as details to your account like how long you've been driving or what your star rating is or the last deposit amount they won't be able to verify any of it and they will hang up immediately.

if you don't question them they will attempt to send you a verification text message to get your username and password which will be followed by, i'm assuming, the transfer of all your funds from your uber earnings into another account.

if anyone has any connections to someone that works at uber in security that i can give more details to i would love to help. i also grabbed the license plate of a van that was idling behind me that might have been associated with the attempt to phish my account info.

be careful guys"

"fb marketplace phon scam so i saw a listing for a phone for a couple hundred bucks and messaged the seller and asked some questions and after a bit of messaging, it seemed legit enough for me (my judgement was a bit skewed as i was desperate/in a rush to get a new phone). afteri pay, dude says he'll ship it the next day. next day, i go to ask him for the tracking number and i can't find the conversation so i realize i got scammed and assume he either blocked me or deleted his account. i spoke to my bank and filed a claim and hopefully they accept it.

i was on facebook marketplace again the other day and saw the listing again from the exact same seller and via his account, was able to find our conversation again. turns out he didn't block me or delete the account - it was just that for some reason i just couldn't find the conversation again the day after i sent him the money.

so at this point, i screenshot and screen record his profile and other listings and find his other social media accounts via his facebook account. now, i'm not sure what i should do. his location is 10-20 miles from me but when i messaged him, he said was somewhere that was much farther and not possible to meetup (i think he may do this to make people more willing to have the phone shipped). should i message him again and see what's up? in that case i'm almost certain he'll block me on facebook and not sure if that would leave me unable to to pursue it further. or should i get someone else or perhaps the police involved before contacting him again? i know if i message him again asking for the money back, he'll make some excuse or block me or something so i don't necessarily want to contact him again just yet until i figure out how i should handle this."

hi, stranger!  
i hacked your device, because i sent you this message from your account.  
 if you have already changed your password, my malware will be intercepts it every time.  
 you may not know me, and you are most likely wondering why you are receiving this email, right?  
 in fact, i posted a malicious program on adults (pornography) of some websites, and you know that you visited these websites to enjoy  
 (you know what i mean).  
 while you were watching video clips,  
 my trojan started working as a rdp (remote desktop) with a keylogger that gave me access to your screen as well as a webcam.  
 immediately after this, my program gathered all your contacts from messenger, social networks, and also by e-mail.  
 what i've done?  
 i made a double screen video.  
 the first part shows the video you watched (you have good taste, yes ... but strange for me and other normal people),  
 and the second part shows the recording of your webcam.  
 what should you do?  
 well, i think $750 (usd dollars) is a fair price for our little secret.  
 you will make a bitcoin payment (if you don't know, look for ""how to buy bitcoins"" on google).

 you have 2 days (48 hours) to pay. (i have a special code, and at the moment i know that you have read this email).  
 if i don't get bitcoins, i will send your video to all your contacts, including family members, colleagues, etc.  
 however, if i am paid, i will immediately destroy the video, and my trojan will be destruct someself.  
 if you want to get proof, answer ""yes!"" and resend this letter to youself.  
 and i will definitely send your video to your any 19 contacts.

"lost phone scam...? what's the end game here? hi,

last night my sister-in-law got a facebook message from a stranger. the message essentially said:

 ""hi, i found this phone, i'm looking to find the owner, your name popped up in the last notification on the phone, so i thought i'd reach out to you to find the owner"" -- another message was sent with a picture of the phone (an iphone xs) with the relevant notification on the lock screen.

the notification message was from a facebook group-chat with my wife, her sister and her mother. the picture with the phone in it did indeed have an accurate recent message from that group. ie, it did appear to be my mil's phone.

my sil sent a message back to the stranger indicating that it did appear to be her mother's phone, and gave her stepfather's phone number to contact to return it. no response was given to this message from the stranger.

about an hour later my wife got in contact with her mother... her phone is not lost, she has possession of it.

i assume this is some kind of scam, but i don't understand the end game. should we be worried about this interaction? comes across as extremely strange, but i don't see what the stranger is after here, clearly they have faked the facebook notification, and potentially they know the victim in this case has a particular model of phone.

seems that bare minimum this stranger has access to my mil's facebook account in order to fake the facebook group message notification that was on phone from the stranger's picture."

"craigslist rent scam?  [https://imgur.com/a/dsb4oir](https://imgur.com/a/dsb4oir) 

&amp;#x200b;

currently looking on craigslist for an apartment for my family. it's the last resort since we have to move out by the end of the month and one of our applications didn't get accepted :/ i really don't want to try and rent this place out and find out its a scam. does anyone have any insight into this?"
"lionnik.com and niftyshopping.com i’m trying to buy two video games from these websites. i put two websites because they have a similar website layout. 
it’s also bizarre that they have other categories like clothing or beauty products, but it shows nothing.
also not to mention the price seems kinda fishy. has anyone made purchases on these websites?
is it a scam?"
got this email forwarded to me using a friend's name. clicked the link without thinking and it took me to an unavailable site domain. any idea what it is? 
"i fell into a craigslist rental scam this was for my boyfriend whose japanese.

we did a application form of his previous address, phone number and email. basic information.

however, we gave photo of his passport and driver’s id.

what can i do in this case to help avoid identity theft or worse?

he’s living in the usa on student visa...

i’m really worried for him and we were happy to find a nice rental but unfortunately after i decided to look up the template and information they gave, it was definitely a scam. we didn’t transfer money.. thankfully."

"i’ve been scammed, need help so this is literally my first time selling stuff online and i ended up falling for the paypal payment pending send tracking info email spoof scam. i realized this was a scam as he got his package sent to him i didn’t get my money. i asked him what was up and he hasn’t responded yet. i’m guessing he’s using his alt account on instagram but he’s posted on it and he’s a photographer. i checked who he follows to see if maybe he pops up in one of them and sure enough there’s an account that’s also a photographer and lives in the same area as the delivery address. is there anything i can do with this information i have?"
"i think i’ve fallen for a scam, and i don’t know what to do! any advice will help. recently i’ve spoken to a man promising to pay me returns from an investment. i initially payed him $100 to invest in forex(foreign currency exchange) trading and he would send me my original amount and any money that the investment made. he said he would take a 10% cut of the profit which i was fine with. then after saying my investment is ready he proceeded to tell me there is a withdrawal and a surcharge fee. this is when i became skeptical of the situation, but i sent him the money anyway ($75.87). after sending it to him he said that he “ had a power outage and his system didn’t process it” and that i have to “send the surcharge and withdrawal fee again,” and he will return the original fee with my investment. when i asked for a refund on my $175.87 and he could keep the profit, but he said it was an $100  refund fee. i made the mistake of paying for all of these transactions through venmo linked to a debit card. is there anything i can do or am i just out of luck and out of money?"

"i need advice for a neighbor that just sold their truck my neighbor just sold their truck.  he may have listed it on facebook marketplace (i can confirm if that information is needed).  someone within a few blocks of where we live contacted him about possibly buying the truck.  he's in his early 40s and had his 60+ year old father come and test drive the truck on two separate occasions.  he came by yesterday and bought the truck and handed my neighbor $5,000 in cash.  we are not in a rich area where people would just have that kind of cash normally.  he did not ask for any receipt and none was given.

&amp;#x200b;

three hours later my neighbor receives a text message saying the truck is ""undriveable"" and he wants his money back.  my neighbor texts back ""i don't know what you did to the truck after you took it but all sales are final.  buyer's wife starts texting him saying it took them 6 months to save that much money and that he (my neighbor) knows what he did.  then they text back and say they're going to have the truck towed back to his house and he can keep $500 for his trouble.  my neighbor refuses.  they're talking about suing him and whatnot.  

&amp;#x200b;

my neighbor is a 21 year old kid.  they're definitely attempting to intimidate him into taking the truck back.  when the guy gave him the cash my neighbor signed the title over to this guy.  he didn't have tags or insurance to which my neighbor mentioned to him he needed and it was illegal to drive around without them. 

&amp;#x200b;

everything about this sounds fishy to me.  why would he give him $5,000 in cash?  why wouldn't he ask for a receipt of some kind?  why would they just offer up $500 for his ""trouble"" if they truly believe they were duped?  by the way, the kelly blue book for the truck was $7,000 for the condition the truck was in.

&amp;#x200b;

does this sound like a scam to anyone else?  has anyone experienced or heard of anything similar?"

i got an email from someone else saying they would like movers to pick it up since they are moving to my city for a job. only asked what my bottom dollar would be for that one though, no other details worked out yet. 

i asked why he would trust me this much, and he replied he said he was a man of god, dealt with online sellers all the time, and never get scammed. 

anyways, can someone give me possible ways i could get scammed by this? i'm thinking of just asking him for paypal or venmo, or even have the bank send it via email (my bank can do this) and see what his reply is?."

"i received a package i did not order from amazon delivered to my house. amazon told me to keep it. it was an iphone 11. last weekend i got email bombed, it was a nightmare. thousands of spam emails for random websites and newsletters from all over the world started flooding in.

i immediately think i got hacked, and i was right. my paypal as well as my amazon accounts were compromised and someone had made purchases to the tune of about $3,000. i call amazon, shut down my amazon account. i call my bank, cancel my bank card. change all my passwords and set up 2 step verification. i filed fraud charges with paypal and my bank, and my money is returned to me by the end of the week.

today, i received a package in the mail, addressed to me, and i have not made any orders since this incident. i open it up, and inside is a simplemobile iphone 11 pro 64gb. no packing slip, receipt or return address anywhere.

i call amazon, tell them that back story, give them my email and the tracking code from the package and they tell me this order was purchased with my bank card that i canceled last weekend. i tell them the exact amount of one of the charges i got last week, and they say yes, that is this phone. the exact amount for this phone had already been refunded to my account.

the whole time the guy on the phone is just as confused as me. he keeps saying this sounds like a known scam technique and they will launch an internal investigation, but cannot notify me or give me a resolution. i ask him so what do i do with this phone? and the guy says ""you have no obligation to do anything with it, you can give it away or keep it, we will not accept the return"". 

so now i'm stuck wondering to do with this really expensive phone i have no use for. i think it's locked to simplemobile so i don't think i can just put my sim card in.

tldr: i was hacked and one of the orders from the hack arrived to my house a week later after i had already received a refund. amazon told me to keep an iphone 11 pro i did not pay for, and now i don't know what to do with it."

"a phone scam with me calling an old 800 number for a chimney sweep a post here earlier made me think of one time i ended up talking to some indian scammers when i tried to call a chimney sweep.

my husband and i were having a stove installed in our new house and i asked on a community fb page for recommendations to have our chimney swept and inspected because i had never used one before. a few people recommended the same local person, so i looked up his number. first thing i found was a photo with his truck with a 1800 number on the side so i called to make an appointment.

the 800 number was one of those ""you're eligible to receive special gifts!"" blah blah. i figured it was weird but it said press 1 to talk to someone, so i did.

i got a guy with a heavy indian accent who assured me that he was, of all things, a chimney sweep in my area and he just needed my full name, address, and a cc to ""hold a deposit."" at this point i asked him what state we were in (since he was supposedly local) and he told me that states are a ""fake construct"" and dont actually exist! he then started yelling at me. 

i hung up and googled again and got a local number, and talked to the chimney sweepers wife. i told her what had just happened and she said shes heard it before, they got rid of the 800 number and someone gobbled it up and was scamming. i never thought a tiny local business would have to deal with that! make sure you're calling correct numbers!!"

"craigslist apartment rental. is this a scam? hi guys, my girlfriend is looking to sublease an apartment in miami for 2 months. she found one eventually on craigslist with someone who sent her a sublease contract and payment information.

now we're being a little weary because it is craiglist after all, but the points of concern arise in the alleged owner's overall conduct. we were told she needs someone to take over her lease because she is leaving the state due to job relocation, which seems fine. however she asked us to send money to her mother's bank of america zelle payment. when we asked why we couldn't just send it to her account, the owner said her ex boyfriend had previously taken advantage and pulled all the funds out of her bank account. she is going through court hearings with her ex, however that is why she is unable to access her bank account currently.

i called the owner on my girlfriend's behalf due to some of the concerns, and she sounded to be an older woman in her possible 40s, however when we asked her to send identification just to ease our minds, she sent us a passport scan which states she is 25. through emails, she seems rather cooperative and says that she understands our worries but it'd be really unfortunate for my girlfriend to move out to a new city and find out she was scammed and have no place to stay.

then came the request for my payment information so they could first charge a $4.99 processing fee ""required"" to activate the gift card. it sounded like every 'nigerian prince' email ive ever read, so i said no thanks and hung up. it really confused me though and it took me a few minutes to realize my mistake.

"so i wanna see if you guys can help me out to see if this is a scam my helper (indonesian) recently found a ‘husband’ she wants to marry. he claims to be a us military member in egypt. here’s why i suspect it’s a scam
1. bad english
2. they never met in real life
3. photos look like he’s a model
4. claims his family members died when he was young and his grandma also recently died
5. told her to quit her job and to bail him out of army to get married, and the us army email that she used to bail him out seems off and also the us army dept uses poor english 

but she’s convinced that it’s real because
1. her friend (who is a helper she claimed to be friends with in real life) has recommended the guy to her
2. she has video called the guy to make sure it is him
3. her other friend has also married off to an american army member, they now have a family of 4 with 2 babies.

i’m first worried it’s just a scam for money, the 3rd point that convinced my helper makes me think it’s something more than a scam (closer to human trafficking?) i hope i am wrong. can someone advice what i should do?"

morris township — a morris township resident was scammed out of $80,000 by someone claiming to be an apple employee who claimed to be able to offer malware protection, according to police. when the call came in, it showed an apple logo and information about the company, according to a screen shot of the call posted by morris police. morris township police capt. robert shearer told nj.com that the money was taken from the woman's bank account after she willingly gave her account and routing number.  the money will likely never be recovered especially if went overseas, shearer told nj.com.

the routing number allowed scammers to withdraw money from the account, open new lines of credit and get cash advances, shearer told nj.com. ""please always check by calling a company first before transferring any money. this could be from other companies than apple (jcp&amp;l, pse&amp;g, verizon, irs, etc.). they should not be asking for wire transfers. be vigilant and contact the customer service numbers listed on your bills,"" police wrote in their facebook message. "

"whats the scam? used car lot, unused. there is a used car lot that opened about five months ago in a small town near me.  i drive by there often and it is rarely open for business. usually there is no one there. there are only 4-5 used cars in the lot.  normally when you see a fake business that is never open you think money laundering, but that doesn't make sense in this case because used car sales is not really a cash business and it involves a lot of official paperwork.  there are plenty of reputable car lots within a reasonable distance.  so, whats the scam?  what could someone gain from opening a sham car lot?"
"reloadit pack a friend of mine was looking through craigslist for a nintendo switch. he came across a brand new switch for 250 dollars. after agreeing to buy the switch, the guy said he wanted the payment with something called a reloadit pack. my friend went out, bought the reloadit pack and gave him a picture of the receipt as proof that he was very serious about buying the switch. the guy agreed he would wait until my friend recieved the switch first, and then ask my friend for the code on the back of the reloadit pack. 
after a couple days, the guy has his phone turned off and does not respond to any of my friends messages. 
he decided to just say screw it and redeem the card for his own use and turns out the card was already redeemed into another reloadit safe account. note that he never once scratched the back of the card nor gave the guy any other information about the reloadit pack itself.
 how did my friend get scammed? was there something on the receipt that couldve gave something away?"
"paypal hacked? don’t know if this fits here, but recently someone got access to my daughter’s paypal account and ordered nearly $3k of merchandise from adidas.  

she called paypal to dispute it through their automated service, and then changed her password.  but then more purchases were made after the password change.  she tried removing her linked account twice but it would reappear. apparently she couldn’t do that or deactivate her account while there were transactions pending.

paypal kept her on the hook for the amounts that cleared her bank, close to $500.  they sent her an email stating that their investigation determined that the unauthorized activity was in keeping with her account history.  end of story.

it baffles me as to how they came to their conclusion.  previous to all this she’d never bought online from adidas, never made such large purchases, and never shipped anything to a place she didn’t reside (the shipping address of the unauthorized purchases was to an apartment building in a town she never lived in).  she doesn’t know anyone who lives there.

i’d always heard how great paypal was about protecting their account holders from scams and fraud, and never heard about any account hacking.  but now i’m concerned and may close my own account with them.  fuck paypal.  luckily her bank reversed the charges after she contacted them too."

i looked into similar reddit posts from here and the census is it’s a scam. that your bank would never ask for you to deposit this way or phone company.

i suppose that might make this post irrelevant, still thought better to check with others and warn those who may not think to research it first.

because yeah, i would love a deposit like that but really doubt it’s not something to steal my bank info."
"has anyone else been getting these weird advertising text messages with .xyz links? [https://i.imgur.com/mbb8jmn.png](https://i.imgur.com/mbb8jmn.png) example of one i just received

i have started getting pretty much one of these every day, sometimes two. they're always advertising some weight loss or something similar with a weird link ending in .xyz (which i know is a legitimate domain extension, but its always .xyz). and for the record, i do no searching for diets or weight loss on my own so i am not sure how or why i am being marketed this.

i always block the numbers but they seem to have no shortage of numbers to send text messages from. it started a few months ago and has been increasing in frequency significantly in the last month or so."
"scamming the scammer for over 400 bucks so i was hunting for a rental house for the valentines day weekend and wasn't finding much, so i popped into the local craigslist page and found a place at a decent but very believable price. no contact info or website, so i emailed through the craigslist relay, everything sounds legit up until he asks me to pay using zelle or bank transfer. immediately knew it was a scam but i played along acting confused because i'd never used zelle, he sends me the zelle info to send the payment. at this point i reverse image search the cabin and find the actual property owner info and call them. he confirmed that he has had this scam happen before and angry people show up expecting a rental that is already legitimately reserved and demanding a refund. i give him the links and info to the fake craigslist posting so he can report it. so now i have confirmed that this is 100% a scam so i decide to have a go at this guy and see how far i can get. after a few more confused sounding email regarding how to get the money to him over zelle i send him the request but instead of paying him i sent it as a request for payment. i send a few more messages saying it is not going through and then i get a notification saying a payment has been received. sure enough he approved my payment request and sent me the money he was trying to get me to send him.

so now i have over $400 siting in my zelle acount from a guy in nigeria who was trying to scam me out of my romantic weekend."

"hismile i'm not sure if this is the right sub but i needed to talk about this product. i have been seeing this product advertised everywhere and it needs to be exposed. they guarantee results or it's free on almost half of their currently 140+ running ads but do not disclose obviously in their advertising that you need to take many steps to get this such as before and after photos that require time stamps on both! obviously hoping that you will slip up and miss a step and not be able to get a free refund. they are paying dentists to say the product works and they hide all of their negative reviews from their website. reviews that state it causes sensitivity, taste bad, doesn't work, etc. i bought it and it, as mentioned by these negative reviews didn't work! because they hid these steps from me i missed the steps and couldn't get a refund.  they hide the reviews because they pay trustpilot for this function and report most of their negative ones as spam. or write positive reviews by purchasing items themselves with a 100% off discount.  scamming unknowing customers into not knowing about the return process and not knowing all of their negative reviews. please stay far away. they have already been given warnings by multiple government agencies for their advertising and overall make a unsafe product with very little tested ingredients. ( their main ingredient pap i just discovered is rated by the ghs as an environmental hazard and skin irritant ) 

sorry for the rant i just hate seeing their ads and hate the review manipulation they are allowed to get away with since they don't sell on sites like amazon target etc"

"ruja ignatova and the ""onecoin"" scam - basically, it was a ""cryptocurrency"" backed by a ponzi scheme/mlm selling ""educational"" materials to mine crypto, or something. the founder has vanished, and with that up to $4 billion may have been lost in the scam. ruja is still on the run from the fbi. the wiki page on her is here: https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/onecoin

this video is a good summary of what we know about the fraud so far: https://youtu.be/64xcgvej3ys

her brother (who took over for her) has already been arrested, and he may be facing several decades in prison for his involvement in the scam.

ruja ignatova is still on the run from law enforcement in several countries, including the fbi. my bet is that she's somewhere in south east asia, like bali or thailand. she was known to travel all over the world and probably has multiple residences, as well as a shit-ton of money from investors who she duped in her illegal scheme. 

i'm sure any information leading to her arrest would be nicely compensated."

"the producer scam: music, porn, movies, etc... i work in the entertainment industry in los angeles and there is a very popular scam i see all the time and i will dub it ""the producer scam...""

the setup is simple.  mr. scammer presents himself as a big time producer and ceo of his ""label"" or ""company"" or whatever...  he wants to work with you and promises you will make all this money...

but...  you will be paid ""after"" you perform.  

similarly, there is no legal paperwork whatsoever, you will be paid under the table cash ""after"" you perform.

the ""after"" part will often turn into ""after"" the video, music, clip, etc makes money so you are now gonna get paid on the back end.

now, if this wasn't bad enough, there are some ""producers"" who somehow convince the artist to actually pay the costs of the shoot.  

**how to spot these scammers**.

firstly, all of these ceos, labels, producers, etc have no online footprint.  they have no content, no online history, no brick and mortar listing, no yellow pages, no phone number, no website, no videos on youtube, nothing.... all they have are elaborate stories about why they don't or how they are just getting started...

secondly, they are all broke ass wannabes.  their cars are shit or nonexistant, they try to do everything gorilla style no permits, they can't afford a real studio (despite studios being very cheap to rent), their equipment is 5 to 10 years out of date...

thirdly, no content or references.  again, they will have elaborate stories about why they don't have content or references.  my favorite is ""i'm involved in a legal dispute with netflix or hbo about a show they stole from me...""   really, what is the case number then????  

if you are an artist or performer, money needs to flow to you not from you.  do not fall for that ""you'll get paid ""after"" this gets picked up by netflix..."" bullshit.  also, never do a deal without legal paperwork that clearly spells everything out.  if it is not written down, it does not exist.  promises don't mean shit, put it in writing or else it isn't real.

now, am i saying don't do content trades or work on passion projects?  no.  you can definitely do passion projects or accept equity instead of payment if you really believe in a project but.... it must be in writing!!!!  if it is not in writing, if it is not a contract that you both sign with a witness or notary, it does not exist.  period."

"i got scammed hard! yesterday a friend from many years ago made a post on instagram that she would pay lady’s $500 for 10minutes of work and just to dm her for details. well, me being an idiot and in need of about that much money, i foolishly messaged her and asked what her post was about. she said that she was working on her sketch portfolio for her masters program and she needed more sketches of the female form, more specifically, nude. now i have no problem with nudity in an artistic form and i think it can be very liberating and empowering. so i agreed to model for her to help with her project. i sent the pictures to her over instagram messenger even though i kind of had a gut feeling to ask to send it to her phone (i lost her number over the years) but i didn’t because i trusted her. after i sent the pics she asked for my venmo info and said the money should post by 12am pacific time. when i woke up there was no money and in fact there was a post from another mutual friend that said “hey m’s account got hacked don’t respond to it”. my heart sank to my stomach and i immediately knew i had fucked up. i’ve since deleted my instagram, facebook, and venmo account but i’m terrified whoever hacked her account is still going to get ahold of me somehow and blackmail me. i’m not sure what else i should do?"

"website to give scam phone numbers hello, i was wondering if anyone knew what the website was where you could enter a phone number as well as information on what they were trying to scam people out of and then it would just basically mass call that phone number until the scammers have no choice but to ditch that phone number. i found it once watching a guy scam bait on youtube but i forgot to save that site."
"anyone used aoeah? aoeah.com is a third party merchant for a multitude of games that have cosmetics, items, and currency such as fifa, rocket league, etc. ever since rocket league switched their market over to no more gambling, i've refused to purchase their new currency because of the ridiculous prices. my friends use aoeah and swear that it's legitimate.  

i have reservations because, although i trust my friends, the site looks sketchy. there are really weird grammatical errors and misspellings and everything looks too good to be true. the prices aren't that much cheaper than some other sellers or trade sites so it's not overly obvious.  

i'm going with it's better safe than sorry but was curious if anyone else has had experiences with them."
"scammed by a locksmith back in november 2019, i got these guys, rapid-locksmiths.co.uk run by the scammer paul johnson to come to fix a broken door panel, they showed up, did the quote for £498 pounds, and took a £249 deposit off me and said that the replacement part would arrive within two weeks and that then they would be in touch to book the fitting.

2 weeks passed, and i had not heard back, i thought there may have been a delay so i waited a further week, i called up, and was told that they would speak to the boss to find out what’s happening, i never got a call back, so i called back every few days and got the same response.

this went on for a few more weeks, after over a month, i’d had enough and requested to cancel my order and get a refund for my deposit, i did not get anything back, i chased several times, eventually getting a response saying that the request had been put through and that i’d be getting a refund, they asked for my bank details, which i sent immediately, however i didn’t receive my refund. after a few more weeks and more phone calls trying to find out what was happening, i had enough again and sent an email threatening to submit a claim with the small claims court, to which i received a reply after a couple of days.

they said i’d receive a refund in 2 weeks, 2 weeks pass, still no refund, so i start calling again and email, but they stop responding, and eventually block my number, so i went ahead and filed the claim with the courts, they didn’t respond to my claim request, so i requested a judgement by default. in addition i also reported them to actionfraud, and the tradings and standards agency.

i posted a couple of reviews on trust pilot, and after my second one where i called them out as scammers and thieves, i finally got a response, this time from paul johnston himself requesting for me to call him.

i called up, and he said that he’d release the refund if i remove my review, in addition he started lecturing me about how i can’t post defamatory reviews and defame his character, to which i responded, and you can’t just take peoples money and disappear without providing a service, and that he had broken the consumer rights act. he remained adamant, after he said, that he’d “taken advice” and that i did not need to remove the review, i had already done so after his first request however in an attempt to get my money back. looked like we were finally getting somewhere, and he became much more responsive and actually answered the phone and replied to my emails.

on another call, i’d asked, if he is really running a legitimate company and genuinely had 50,000 happy customers, what the hell went so wrong with my simple job, he said he didn’t have the details and that he’d investigate after my refund was released.

next day arrives, i call him again in the morning, he tells me that the refund has been confirmed as “released” whatever the hell that means and that i’ll get it by midday, shock and awe, no money by midday.

i won’t go as far to implicate myself in slander, especially as he has threatened me with any legal action to any consequences of him losing business from my bad review, shows even more what a piece of work he is, but i honestly believe he is ripping people off left right and centre, i certainly feel ripped off.

at no point has he even offered an apology for this situation in fact, he’s been snarky with me on the phone, brisk, dismissive.

at this point, i’m just gonna make sure to try and ruin his seo attempts and post everywhere i can to ensure that when others search for his company that they will see my review and hopefully steer clear of these people.

at the time of writing still no refund, this guy is a bold faced liar.

i lost my cool toward the end of this and called him a c word by email, after that he started threatening me, so i called him up to record the threat which he reiterated stating that he knows where i live and where i work. i have since reported him to the police but i highly doubt anything will be done."

"scammers from peoples mobile numbers so a friend keeps getting calls from these scam numbers, that are all in chinese and have a tune in the back, only for them to end. we are in the uk so of course dont understand what's being said. for a while it was voicemails without calls, but upon calling one of the numbers, it was just some normal guy, middle aged english guy who had no clue about the operation of the scams, i advised him to contact his mobile provider. he contacted them and for a while the calls stopped. but now they are back, and are calls, without voicemails, that end themselves.

now i know about the operations of many types of scams, however, these are from random peoples mobile numbers, some of which cant be called back as they apparently arent a valid number. the scammers are not asking for anything, as no dates are said or no numbers are said such as ""press whatever to call"". it doesn't seem like a tech support scam, and ends itself without giving the option to leave a voicemail.

i wouldnt normally care about this sort of thing, but it  just seems weird and i couldn't tell why they would call at all. any experience or help with this would be much appreciated, sorry for the long post, any questions are welcome. thanks."

"scammed by an detroit bank? this is my first thread here so i'm doing my best to go by all the rules. also i'm dutch so excuse me for any errors in my writing.
please don't make comments about how ignorant or stupid we were because we know that now.. 

my boyfriend and me had a dream house we wanted to buy. as we live in the netherlands it's difficult to buy your first house due to all the laws we have. my boyfriends dad lives in the u.s and he came with a tip to lend money here because the laws and rules are easier and it had a lower interest rate. 

he gave us a website from capital house funding in detroit and they would help us out. they work for the western lot bank in detroit. our contactperson was p. 
he made up a contract for us (which we signed and they have all our information)

before we signed the contract we did a lot of google research and we couldn't find anything negative about the bank or chf. in fact we couldn't find very much at all but we thought that was a good thing. 

the bank told us we had to pay money for the bank codes they had to use to transfer the money to europe. they explained that the amount of the codes were calculated by the amount of money we wanted to lend. in total we had to have 3 codes we had to pay before we could use our bank account from western lot bank.
so in our case... they were a bit expensive. 
as time went by we had troubles contacting the bank. on their websites they have multiple emailadresses of their different departments so we used all those email addresses and the one of our contact person p, to hopefully have a quicker response. 
they also had a costumer service telephone but they never answered. we always got an automatic message that everyone was busy..
because we live in europe we also had to deal with time differences so that was also a factor that made contact a bit hard. 

in december of last year we finally got all the codes we needed and besides money it costed us a lot of blood sweat and tears and sooo much stress. but... we could buy our dream house!
we made the transaction, we saw the money was withdrawn from our account and now we had to wait a few days before it was on our own account.
but that never happened.. western lot bank claimed they suffered from offshore issues because the government made new laws and because of that they couldn't secure a safe transaction. they had to change their protocols to meet the laws and that would take time.
time we didn't have, because we were getting in trouble with the owners of the house. 

they came with a strange solution. they would send a money order to us so we could take that to our own bank and use that to pay for the house.
using money orders is not a usual thing in the netherlands so we were very hesitant about it.  

then western lot came with another solution, strangely they could send the money to an associate bank in london and from london it would be easier for us to receive the money. 
but... we had to pay for that too. 
we refused since it was not our problem they were facing offshore issues. they were delaying us for months now, it had to be a service from the bank to its customers. 
but they didn't and promised us the offshore issues were resolved in the first week of january.

you guessed it... it's still not solved and it's getting harder to get in touch with them.
my boyfriend said he would fly over to detroit and visit the bank himself. at first they were hesitant about that but now they are open to it. 
i don't like the idea of him going because i'm scared he never comes back. or they let him getting arrested.

so i did more research on google and studied the website of western lot. 
they claimed to be partners with delta airlines and michigan state university. but on their websites i can't find any reference to western lot. 
the bank said they have their own mail service they work with. it's called monarch mail services. i can't find anything of that so called company. in december when the bank wanted to send the money to london they wanted to use monarch as flight mail carrier (hope that's the correct term) and we could enter the website which i found sketchy. they had a photo of an airplane with their logo photoshopped on it for example. 

they website of capital house funding is for me completely gone... if you google the address in detroit it says: permanently closed.
p said that's because they recently moved and it wasn't changed yet.

if you google the address of the western lot bank, i found a yelp website where it also stated that the building is closed. 

we understand by now we are most likely scammed. the only thing i want now is to terminate the contract we have. 

i really hope someone can help me find more information about the bank and help us how we can end this."
"i'm pretty sure i got a scam call. kinda freaked out though. for the record, i don't answer numbers that aren't in my contacts lists. however, all the numbers are listed in my call log, and i got curious tonight and started googling the unknown numbers on my call log. most of the numbers were obvious scams and telemarketers, a few were from my hospital and college (which i promptly put in my contacts list). one of them was from my local police station from several days ago, which is strange because they have no reason to contact me. i'm 18 years old and have a clean record, so there should be no reason for the cops to call me.

i did a little searching to see if/why a police station would call me, and how warrants work, and other stuff like that. as far as i know, the police won't call you. if you have a warrant, they'll just show up at your house or work and arrest you. if you have a court hearing, they'll send you a letter. i couldn't find any definitive answer regarding bench warrants (some websites said colorado will send you a letter, others said cops will just come and arrest you), though i'm certain i don't have one, considering i've got a squeaky clean record and have done absolutely nothing wrong. also, i received a ballot for the primaries in the mail a couple days ago. i'm pretty sure i wouldn't have gotten a ballot if i was actually in legal trouble. 

i'm pretty sure the call was just a scammer disguising their number as my local police station to freak me out, which (i'm ashamed to admit) worked. i have an anxiety disorder which finds the dumbest shit to make me worry about, and i'm also a young and dumb 18-year-old, which makes me a primary target for these kinds of scams. 

i guess i'm just posting here so y'all can ease my wary overthinking mind, and i can turn in my ballot tomorrow without my anxiety making me wonder if i'll be arrested at the ballot box."

"cnpr - is it a scam? **my goal for this post is to provide a comprehensive study as to whether the cnpr program is legitimately recognized in the pharmaceutical industry, and i will also be taking a look into any public court records filed under its parent companies name.** i will be attaching a lot of evidence as well as screenshots of my interactions with the potential scammers in question.

after following a few leads, i was fortunate to be contacted by not one, but two job recruiters offering me a very lucrative entry level job as a pharmaceutical sales representative. the only catch however, was that i needed to pay for the $300 cnpr program. here are \[screenshots\]([https://imgur.com/a/n6u8lox](https://imgur.com/a/n6u8lox)) of my interactions with both scammers. 

here are the websites of the companies they work for

*  [http://www.circlehealthcarerep.com/](http://www.circlehealthcarerep.com/) 
*  [http://www.pharmagen-usa.com/](http://www.pharmagen-usa.com/) 

both company websites list bland, irrelevant, and almost useless information to promote the sale of particular pharmaceutical products and don't even show their affiliated partnerships with any hospitals or health clinics. 

i was able to understand the facade they have create much more after finding the court docket for naprx vs. aims medical sales college. here is the link to read the full court case:

*  [https://www.scribd.com/document/346236308/naprx-vs-aims-medical-sales-college-medical-sales-college](https://www.scribd.com/document/346236308/naprx-vs-aims-medical-sales-college-medical-sales-college) 

**excerpt from court docket:** "" napsr is not a true “trade association.” rather, napsr and namsr are internet façades created as part of the napsr/namsr scheme. napsr and namsr do not reveal to the public where their operations are actually conducted. rather, napsr and namsr either provide false addresses or an address for a mailbox in a ups store. both napsr and namsr are registered in nevada and use the same registered agent, and both have a sole person allegedly acting as director, president, secretary and treasurer, and that person’s address is the same ups mailbox in a strip mall. the person who napsr has held out as its ceo and president – steven neece – is different from the person registered with nevada as president, and is also likely a false façade. the linked-in profile for mr. neece was taken down the day after msc pointed out to napsr that it was a fake profile with a picture of another person pulled from the internet""

* **here's my summary of the court docket before you jump into it so you aren't completely lost:** aims medical sales college provides a legitimate medical equipment sales certification, and claims that napsr, which offers the cnpr certification, are falsely leading people online to buy their certification program. 

now i will be looking at the official cnpr \[order package\]([https://www.napsronline.org/buy\_1.asp](https://www.napsronline.org/buy_1.asp))

* part of the package is a yearly subscription to a magazine called ""pharmaceutical executive"". i tried searching for this magazine online, but their only website led to a 404 error.
* it also comes with an outdated textbook with practice quizzes and a 2 hour exam that hasn't been updated in at least 5 years. 

looking at the websites \[review tab\]([https://www.napsronline.org/cnpr-pharmaceutical-sales-program/cnpr-reviews-can-it-really-help/](https://www.napsronline.org/cnpr-pharmaceutical-sales-program/cnpr-reviews-can-it-really-help/)) , one flaw that seemed ironic to me was a link saying ""click here to see thousands of cnpr grads!"" but instead led to a ""page not found"". 

&amp;#x200b;

**so is the cnpr certification a scam? review the evidence and decide for yourself.**"

"does this look like a scam? so me and a buddy of mine are musicians looking to rent a house in august where we can turn the basement into a studio. we recently found a good location on craigslist which looks very promising. however, a lot of red flags keep showing up. for instance, the contact persons phone number leads back to a company in san francisco (we're in kansas) called catzilla inc. which doesn't have a website and we can barely find any info on it (other than it exists and has about 3 employees). the person we've been communicating with hasn't explicitly refused to meet with us (as we haven't explicitly suggested to do so yet) but has been communicating with us through text and email. we filled out an application form and paid the $30 fee through venmo. before her ""company"" even approved our applications, she asked us to send the deposit, also through venmo (which is a huge red flag to me), but i insisted we look at the contract before any money is payed. the only assurance i have that this might not be a scam is that we actually arranged to go to the house, where the current tenants were expecting us and showed us inside. the pictures on craigslist were definitely of the same house we went to, with the correct address. my only thought is that if we are being scammed, the tenants have to be in on it. hopefully, i'm just being paranoid and everything turns out to be legitimate but i'd rather loose just the $30 on the application than hundreds on a scam and also end up on the street. we're currently awaiting approval so we can sign the lease on [rightsignature.com](https://rightsignature.com) (never heard of it) and then wire the money through venmo. i wasn't sure where else to turn to for advice so any suggestions would be highly appreciated. thanks!"

**public organisation procedures research phase 1** 

what do organizations use conflict management for? 

for any organization to be effective and efficient in achieving its goals, the people in the organization need to have a shared vision of what they are striving to achieve, as well as clear objectives for each team / department and individual. you also need ways of recognizing and resolving conflict amongst people, so that conflict does not become so serious that co-operation is impossible. all members of any organization need to have ways of keeping conflict to a minimum - and of solving problems caused by conflict, before conflict becomes a major obstacle to your work. this could happen to any organization, whether it is an ngo, a cbo, a political party, a business or a government.

conflict management is the process of planning to avoid conflict where possible and organizing to resolve conflict where it does happen, as rapidly and smoothly as possible.

once there was a girl called clarissa, she was 10 years old and lived in a mental hospital because she killed her parents. she got so bad, she started to kill all the staff members in the hospital. so the government thought that it would be the best idea to get rid of her. so they set up a room to kill her as soon as possible. but it somehow went wrong, the machine they were using went wrong and she sat there, in agony for hours until she finally died. every week of the day of her death, she returns to the person that reads this letter. on monday night at around 12:00, she creeps into your room and kills you but slowly and painfully. slowly cutting different parts of your body. then watches you bleed to death. share this to 20 people and she'll forget about you! don't believe me? here are some examples
1. jenny didn't believe in it and deleted it without reading it. on monday night, she was sleeping until she heard heavy footsteps and what she saw was clarissa with a large knife. and you know what happens next
2. tom sent this to only 5 people because he thought it was fake but oh, how he was wrong. he got killed because he didn't finished the task 
3. joeanna sent this to only 19 people because she thought she'd finished the task but then she was wrong.

"almost fell for utility scam today i consider myself pretty skeptical and unlikely to fall for a scam, but i got absolutely taken for a ride today.

i received an urgent call from one of the managers that works for me that the power company has been calling threatening to shut off the power that day due to non-payment. this was a little surprising, but believable since i have forgotten to put utility bills on autopay once or twice in the past.

manager texts me the number to call them back at and i don't think twice about dialing it. this was my first mistake, i should have gone to their website first.

i immediately get hit by an ivr prompt that sounds legit, go through a couple menus to get the billing person. he asks for the account phone number and account info. i don't have it, but give him an address. he says he can't find any matches, and then i eventually find the right phone number and we get to my ""account.""

he says we're overdue by ~$600, they've sent two notices, but if we can pay at least $400 today, they won't cut it off. i've got my card out, ready to pay, and then boom

scammer: okay, so we have a new app you can pay through so your payment details will remain secure. do you have an iphone or android?  
me: yeah, i've got an iphone  
scammer: please put me on speaker phone and then go to the app store  
me: [goes to the app store]  
scammer: and then i want you to type in cash app, that's how we accept payment now.  
me: [hangs-up]  

it's really scary though. i'd have handed over my bank details or credit card in a heartbeat and then he did something as stupid as ask me to pay through a money app."

"help!! bought an oculus rift on ebay, received 3 plates instead! hi guys

this is my first proper post on reddit, but i had to vent somewhere. 

as the title says, i've just bought an oculus rift for £180 on ebay, 3 days later i arrive home from work to see a package outside my door (placed there by my sister who signed for the package). and i'm soon abit wary, i remembered the pictures having a boxed oculus and i was under no illusion that the package in front of my door was not any sort of cuboidal shape. excited, i immediately ripped open the package to find quite a bit of bubble wrap. this is when i started thinking i've been scammed, and to not much surprise i find my package to be nothing but 3 bubbled wrapped plates. woop woop. so instead of being the proud owner of an oculus rift, i've now got 3 shitty plates. so i contact the seller straight away, i'm thinking (probably quite naively) that it must be a simple mix up on the sellers part as they have sold quite a few items. and i'm thinking my oculus has gone to a different person, probably an elderly lady who wanted some plates. i tell the seller my story and send him pictures straight away. the seller comes back saying it has been reported to ebay and could i send more pictures. i oblige and send about 5 pictures this time, of all the angles of my new crappy plates. he then comes back abruptly calling me a fraud and telling me that is not what he sent me. he tells my i've clearly just opened my oculus and then stuffed some plates in the bin bag it was supposed to come wrapped in. 

&amp;#x200b;

at first i thought this guy is just a pure and simple scammer, then i check his feedback and he has 100% positive feedback with over 1000 transactions. now i'm pretty uncomfortable, thinking i might lose out big time here, he tells me that he wrapped up my oculus in aldi bags, then the bin liner, and wrapped everything up with clear tape. so im checking my bin liner, and i do find clear tape, however there is also some cheap brown box tape that is also wrapped up in the bin liner. now i'm thinking that someone down at hermes ( the delivery company) has just plain and simple unwrapped my oculus and replaced it. the package also seems to have signed for itself as only my sister was home and she didnt sign for it. 

&amp;#x200b;

anyone know what to do at this point? i've asked the seller to contact hermes, and i'm hoping that they do. anyone work in these sort of companies, and recognise this kind of behaviour?"

"my steam account got stolen because of my inability to think. this happened to me a few days ago. fortunately i have it back, but i want to share this story with people so they won't have to this with this as i had to. it really stressed me out, so much that i couldn't sleep or think.

well onto the story:it happened 11 february, somewhere around midnight. i was watching netflix series and while i was doing that my friend wrote to me ""hey i really need to talk to you"". so, naturally i asked him what's up. he said ""i accidentally reported you for duplicated items instead of someone else, i'm sorry"". i said that it's ok. he said that i need to confirm that it was a mistake (do note that i never had to deal with such situation before, and i'm stupid sometimes). i said ok what do i need to do? he send me a link to a steam user called renjoy (the scammer). he said to add and message him. it seemd weird but i did it. he responded really quickly, which surprised me. the scammer then proceded to make me do weird ""authorization stuff"". since it was late and i wanted to return to the show i wanted to finish it quickly. i then did something i shouldn't have done. he wanted a steam guard code to change steam credentials. yes you read it right. i frickin' gave him a key to my account without realizing it. when he got that he wanted to steal money from me so he took me to some side to ""check if there isn't any error in item code"". i decided to stop here and told him that i'm tired. he told me that he will ban and delete my account but i didn't care. i closed the call (only i was talking), watched the episode and went to sleep.

before i went to sleep one of my friends wrote to me on discord that my account have been hacked and he was using it to scam him. when i realized it i quickly went to pc to check if i can log in. i couldn't. i was scared. i messaged him to give it back. he wanted 100 dollars for it. i decided to tell him that he can ""go f\*ck himself"" and went to sleep. it wasn't a very good night. i was stressed and slept for a leally short time. as it turned out later my friend who send a link to this guy was actually the scammer himself. my friend was also hacked, he hacked me, and then proceded to hack my friends.the scammed friend warned others but forgot to warn me but its not his fault. i am here to blame for my stupidity.

the only thing i could do was to make a request for steam support. i had to give them valid proof that the account was truly mine. i gave them my gmail notifications of purchases and showed them that the recent changes were made from diffrent ip address while all purchases had the excact same one.

after two days at morning they finally confirmed that the account was mine. i decided to act quickly. i changed my password to more complex one. made new email for steam and activated steam guard on phone. i also saved special codes in any case and saved othey notifications of purchases from steam in case of another hack (this proof of mine wasnt the best one - but was ok i guess; also how you write a request counts - they saw i indeed cared for the account).

and that's all. i hope you enjoyed it. people can learn from mistakes best if they make them themselves. and that's why i'm here to warn you so you won't have to go through this like me.

security of your account is what you shouldn't take lightly.it's best to make a complex password (with random letters and numbers, big and small) and change it from time to time.paswords should be diffrent.you should always secure your account as much as possible.and you should gather proof on your device to later confirm that the account is yours in case of getting hacked.

never click on an unfamiliar link. especially if it's from a stranger, or even a friend if you're not sure. in case of confronting someone like that  you should gaher someone who you trust so they can help and support you so nothing bad would happen.

&amp;#x200b;

anyways that's all. i hope you have a nice day :)"

"use google image search to prevent the rent scam from happening to you or your home for sale i had set my house up for sale. we got the place really spotless and the photographer took phenomenal pics. as soon as it went live we had interest and by a week facebook scammers had it up for rent. the person had scanned a passport and photoshopped my name on it with my old address and probably a rando dude's image from somewhere. 
so here it is on fb, with my home pics from the mls and saying the guy is deaf (so no phone number). he would take first and last and deposit. the rent was some 600 lower than what it might have been and also included all costly utilities... (heh including some we don't have in my neighborhood like gas).    

my realtor pursued it hard and heavy to get it yanked from fb. some poor bastard renter would have been scammed out of a good portion of his move in funds.

i warned my super sweet watchful ex-neighbors that 'renters' might end up scammed and to shoo them away. 

i asked my realtor to make sure the yard sign said for sale only or something of that sort. 

also, i periodically google image search for the living room pic that looks so nice. only bonafide mls listings for today. sigh ... assholes"

"one more sugar daddy scammer while i’m at it- never not had one do a roadrunner routine when the term “ftc” gets dropped. they know what they’re doing is illegal, but there are so many idiots out there... love messing with these guys. "
"sugar daddy scammers- why doesn’t this get talked about more??? i’m guessing it’s because there’s probably a lot of shame for the ppl who get scammed. from my experience via friends, they’re usually gullible young women who don’t know better, or foreigners trying to make a buck. "
i believe i have a fake check but dont know how to handle it. long story short i was sent a check from a seemingly fake and scammy person. i've seem others online get their checks (from the same company/person) checked out by police and the check is indeed real but i'm not sure what i can do with this check other than trash it. any ideas?

ok, so this is a federal job he describes. you can look up federal salaries online. david w. is not listed as living in nv or ma, although there are several people listed under that name living in different areas. i also did not find any information about him online under that job title. after sending a rental application, the person told me i was approved and to fill out the lease agreement asap. the lease agreement did not have his address or phone number or any rental payment method listed. the numbers he listed- one voicemail is automated and the other doesn't say the person's name. i talked to the person on the phone and he had an accent and all he cared about was me signing the lease agreement. i asked for proof that he worked at the location he said he did, such as a phone number or an address, and he didn't provide that. i also asked if he could add an address and phone number to the lease and he said that his lawyer prepared the document so he couldn't do that. the document is just a blanket form that you can download online. i asked him how i would get the rent money to him and he said he would text me the address after i signed the lease agreement. i later looked up the posted rental address and found it listed on zillow for a higher price with additional rental fees. so obviously this person is stealing rental pictures and information and posting as a fake landlord. watch out for any other postings with this name or phone numbers. 

my question though -- what benefit would this person have if i had sent a signed lease agreement? why would a scammer want this before you send them money? he's not david w. so, why?"

"what's the next big scam? i.e. madoff, theranos, juicero, enron, etc. are there any redflags you've seen on large companies that you think might be an outright scam? any things you've heard that are definitely ""too good to be true""? i have some examples. * joshua tetrick and hampton creek (now named ""just, inc."") has been caught buying its own products to inflate its sales numbers, and also changed their name because of it: https://observer.com/2019/02/just-inc-mayonnaise-controversies-theranos-comparison/

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-04/food-startup-ran-undercover-project-to-buy-up-its-own-products

* gwyneth paltrow and goop. i really hope the fda, sec, and ftc is watching this company, because almost all of their products are selling fraudulent ""health benefits"", which either don't exist because they're pseudoscience, or the products are grossly over-priced.

* the honest company and jessica alba. they've already settled a lawsuit for inaccurate product labeling. will they turn it around? or is that just the first in a long line of lawsuits and fraud?

* hunter biden. definitely watching this case closely, there's no rhyme or reason as to why he was on the board of directors at a ukrainian gas company, unless it was to commit fraud.

* hyperloop likely doesn't have the technology to become viable. and while separate from hyperloop, elon musk's urban-car tunnels likely will not be viable. his solarcity plant in buffalo ny also appears to not be manufacturing solar roof tiles there. could be a problem since the ny government subsidized a huge portion of the factory. https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/01/29/does-tesla-make-solar-glass-roof-tile-in-its-buffalo-factory-or-in-china/

* lots of ""stock picking"" channels/people on youtube, who seem to be front-running options trades that they then tell other people about. this is illegal, but it seems like the sec isn't good at following the paper-trails and recognizing it as fraud.

* herbalife and other mlms. i know herbalife had to pay a fine after bill ackman went after them, but they're still in business and the government is allowing their mlm scam to continue.

those are most of the ones that i'm aware of. do you know any others that i could add to the ""scam watch list""?"
"appcoins scam at aptoide market i recently purchased \[tasker\]([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en)) by joão dias from the google play store and was going to buy some of the related plugins, when i saw this message at the \[aptoide market\]([https://en.aptoide.com/](https://en.aptoide.com/)) app.

&amp;#x200b;

\[imgur\]([https://imgur.com/onb4dc4](https://imgur.com/onb4dc4))

&amp;#x200b;

so i looked into appcoins, which seemed to be legit and aptoide market had the apps marked with a ""trusted"" badge. so i went ahead and bought 2 apps autovoice and autotools, from aptoide market using appcoins. but as i had trouble getting the app to work, i contacted the author joão dias (as the error message said i should do).

&amp;#x200b;

\[imgur\]([https://imgur.com/vfjdy45](https://imgur.com/vfjdy45))

\[imgur\]([https://imgur.com/uevs1un](https://imgur.com/uevs1un))

&amp;#x200b;

i was very surprised when i read his response, as joão dias stated that he had no knowledge of the appcoin versions of his apps sold at aptoide market, and that he doesn't recieve any payback from those sales.

&amp;#x200b;

so i contacted the author of another app (az screen recorder) i was going to buy, and got the exact same reply from the author. that their app is only released through google play store and that they have no knowledge of appcoins.

&amp;#x200b;

digging a bit deeper and using \[apk analyzer\]([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.styk.martin.apkanalyzer&amp;hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.styk.martin.apkanalyzer&amp;hl=en)) to display the app info, reveals that the appcoins version sold at aptoide market are signed with a different key than the original author. (a sure sign of unauthorized tampering.)

&amp;#x200b;

the original autovoice app signed by joão dias (the public md5 key and certificate md5 are identical for all of joão dias' apps)

\[imgur\]([https://imgur.com/cfzvjip](https://imgur.com/cfzvjip))

&amp;#x200b;

the autovoice app sold at aptoide market using appcoins.

\[imgur\]([https://imgur.com/ovp04wi](https://imgur.com/ovp04wi))

&amp;#x200b;

so far all the apps i have tested, which is sold using appcoins on aptoide market are modified with unoriginal signature.

&amp;#x200b;

so not only are they selling and stealing the revenue from the original authors. but it's also a case of identity theft, as they are passing the modded apps of as they where released by the real author.

&amp;#x200b;

i have tried contacting aptoide market to no avail and it looks like aptoide market is part of the scam."

right now i'm interested in finding out how they managed to get my mom's phone number, and link it to her facebook and the relation between her and me. i've tried googling, but to no avail. anyone have tips as to how the scammer managed to pull this off?

i called parcelforce with the tracking number i was given and they gave me the name and address of the sender. apparently the senders surname is coincidentally the same as mine and it turns out they paid $78 additionally for the postage. the package according to them contains two bags and is a total of 2.5kg. 

i wonder how they have even gotten my full name and address. i did have my passport and bag stolen from me in the uk last october but i’m not sure if this is connected? 

do i pick the parcel up? or is it too risky and dangerous, and i should just leave it to be sent back to the sender?"

"i just got scammed. pretty badly too, lost about 1600€.

basically i was looking for a new home as my current rental contract is ending. i was kind of in a hurry and didn't notice the signs. made contact with someone online through an add. they said they lived outside my country so as an intermediary airbnb would handle the booking and exchange of key and contract.

they send me the link and it looked legit. even now comparing airbnb's actual site with the phoney ones it is still convincing. there are holes though. on the fake website the home button just refreshes the page and the search bar does nothing at all. just window-dressing. the links name also had clues but i looked at that after the fact.

so i was to transfer 2 months rent as a down payment and security. airbnb would hold the money and release it to the other party after i signed. if i didn't sign i would simply get it back. but a day of waiting after paying i had no reply from them. as i was and am in a rush i called airbnb to check.

in that call i was told they didn't had my reservation number and then i realised i never had to make an account to make the reservation. i had just made one because their service doesn't allow for calls from phone numbers not assigned to an account.

after that, previous red flags seemed a lot more visible. called the bank. alas no way for a charge back. then the police station. sadly only takes cases after an appointment. so i made one for next monday but i guess time is of the essence in these cases and i am losing a lot of it. even went to the place i was looking to rent and rang the doorbell. they had no idea their place was being promoted for renting.

so here i am writing this up. in the hope someone else doesn't fall for it. or who knows maybe anyone here knows a way to get my money back or trick the scammer in sending it back. as i have yet to message them. didn't see the point really.

when i get home i will upload some images to show the red flags i ignored. maybe someone else won't have to learn finding them the way i did."

"website email scam? hi all

we're a digital agency who build websites - received a direct mail the other day:

*hi, i am lidia by name. i need a website for my business. i will like to know if you are available to build and design a website for me. if yes, please kindly get back to me as soon as possible.*

&amp;#x200b;

i replied and they continued: 

*thanks for you response.i am hearing impaired, and this is the reason why i am contacting you via email.*  
*i have a small clothing business for both male and female which i run here in (uk city). i am trying to expand the business and i want you to build a website for this business of mine.*  
*can you do that?* 

i'm intrigued now so said sure we can, they replied:

 *sounds good. i need you to checkout this site (as sample). miss rebel is an ideal sample of what i want. please check it out and let me know if you can do something like that for me.*  
[*http://www.missrebel.co.uk*](http://www.missrebel.co.uk/)

*i am currently dealing with 3 products (cloths, bags and shoes). the 3 products have variations in sizes and colors. four categories of sizes, with five different varieties of colors.*  
*i have 17 different kinds of bags, 21 different kinds of shoes and 53 different kinds of cloths. each kind of each product has variations in color and size.*  
*i need you to add just the different kinds of each product, and allowing visitors to choose what color and size, instead of adding each individually.*  


*example:*  
*shoes*  
 *colour*  
          *blue*  
          *red*  
          *white*  
*size*  
          *10*  
          *12*  
          *14*  
*i want the site to be an e-commerce. so i need you to get back to me with an estimate for the web design and i need your service on the search engine optimization of the site as well. the estimate should include hosting, domain name and search engine optimization of the site.*  


*i have a private project graphic designer. the graphic designer has the text content, images and the logos for the site.*  


*kindly get back to me with the estimate, so that we can proceed from there.*  


so suddenly this sounds more legit.  i reply with an estimate and then we get this reply:

*sounds good.the total estimate meet up with my budget and i am ready to make an upfront deposit of £2250 with my credit card,i will pay £1250 this week and i will pay another £1000 by next week friday after then,  so that you can start the project.*

*what is the name of the machine/merchant service you are going to use to charge my credit card for the upfront deposit and its percentage processing fee?*

  
sounds less legit...  plus we don't take card payments.

i've had endless red flags here and my gut says scam, but basically i don't understand what they can get out of me? they pay, i build a site, they pay the rest, i deliver the site. what's the scam here? i'm sure i'm being ignorant but this is the first time i've got into this scenario.

any advice?"
"need some guidance im afraid i fell for what may be a scam but don’t know what i should do. my brother linked me up with a friend of his thats out of the country, im in the usa. he proposed to pay a bill or a loan for me and i just got to send him half, but since he noticed i was so skeptical about the whole thing he decided to do it free and call my bank and paid my car loan free, but before it got to that point i told him to leave it alone that i didn’t want to do it and he did it anyways. the next day i called the bank and asked who authorized a payment on my loan and they mentioned a name i never heard off, fast forward a month i received the title of the car and loan account closed and all. 

im not sure what is it he does but it works and he keeps proposing stuff, what i do know is that he calls or has another person that calls and authorizes these payments and the funds come from some checks that seemed to really have funds on them. im lost on this and everything is extremely tempting."

"was this an attempted scam? as a preface i lost nothing and was apprehensive from the beginning as this was the 2nd time someone approached me with the same ""offer"" with sligh variance (didn't do anything with the first time)

i had an individual approach me in a grocery store and offer me a ""business opportunity"" and met with him the next day out of pure curiosity to figure out what it was. so the next day we met and he kept talking about how he was looking for someone to partner with him as they ""had 8-10 income streams at $6-8k each per month"" and that he didn't know anyone who was interested so figured he would branch out and talk to people. he went on to talk about some non sense about how its about ""taking companies from offline to online"" and its also ""kind of like amazon partner links where when people are involved you get a percentage of the profit."" when asked what the name of the company was he said ""i'm not comfortable telling you that information yet till i get to know you"" after i get to know you well enough i can introduce you to my partners and they can offer you the position

i apparently asked too many questions as he started to get annoyed and said i'm too focused on the ""what and how it works"" and obviously i'm not interested in such an awesome deal.

he asked if i was in need of money and when i said i am comfortable with where i was at he kinda slipped up and said ""then why are we talking... i'm not looking for people in comfortable situations i need someone who needs more than what they have and are in desperate situations"" and to try to recover he said by that he meant to ""help them out""

he said the next steps would be meet with him again and do a ""phone interview"" with his partner if that went well we would schedule an in person interview with him and then a final 3rd meeting that if i met the cut would be let in on this ""opportunity""

i have the individuals name and when looked up is his real name and real phone number so i can report it to the authorities but i would need more info first.

&amp;#x200b;

so my questions are 

1) what what was this. were they trying to scam me? recruit me? something else?

2) was it a screening for a mlm/pyramid scheme?

3) who do they target and why? (i ask as i have been approached twice by different people)

4) should i report this to police (only reason i have not yet done so is lack of real understanding as to what it is)"

ok, i'm looking for job change so i created linkedin acc. and accepted and sent req to many unknown ppl, obviously you need to look in someone's profile and if they are recruiter you add them so you get job updates.

one person wished me via linkedin message on my birthday, and so he started saying about his business and while conversation he told me he's business man and recruiting people to work for him as a freelancer, i was quite happy cos my current salary is not enough for me to cover my basic expenses.

i told him to explain me more about his business and the type of work i'll be doing. he said some kinda ""online work"". i tried to ask me to explain in brief and he told me to call me for brief discussion. i denied to call him and giving away my number (as i mentioned before that i'm a very paranoid person) i politely told him that i was using my company's provided number and cannot contact him using that number and so he told me to call from landline or mother's number.

i ignored his msg for couple of days and he kept texting ""gn"" and ""gm"" and once he said that i can come for an interview at his office which is just 3 stations  away and would hardly take 10mins from my place to reach there as i live 2 mins from my area metro station.

i told him i would show up at his office but he insisted he said : "" without a single call how can you come "" i ignored later he texted again and this time i  asked him "" heyy, can you tell me a brief about your business? and wt is it about! before i call and appoint for an interview.i totally understand that it might be difficult for you to explain via text message. but you can at least give me a gist of it""

so which he replied "" we are doing an e franchise online project in which we will provide services to 30 mnc's "" and insisted to call so he would explain clearly then come for an interview.

i'm concerned why he is so stubborn that i should call him, i had no issue to drop in for interview cos the area he said is always crowded. and please suggest should i give him a call, if possibly its a fraud, then what it can be?"
"not sure how much ""danger"" i am in hey all,

like many i tried to sell something on on of the many social media sites... wont say more than that. got a response a day later on the item that i thought might take weeks/months to find someone interested.

email sounded not english.. but readable enough to make do. long story short, not having come across this type of scam (though my alarm bells were ringing a little bit.. mostly sounded good). person asked for address and phone and would send me a check. i didn't think nothing of it.. sent the info. few more back and forths and person said they would send check out, i got the check next day, but it was for a bit more than original asking. then came the alarm bells.. but still not enough for me to end it there. person mentioned put check in bank, keep my amount, pay the rest to movers that would pick the item up. i was still not completely sure wth was going on yet, but still felt weird. consulted a few people.. who also apparently didn't know of this scam.. they said put the check in, dont give items to person or money until you are sure it clears. i did so. bank tells me money is available immediately. so now i am thinking sweet.. it's all good. check looked legit, from a company, etc.

then i for the hell of it look up scams with checks and fork me the first one i see talks about how they often say they'll have movers pick up the item, they are out of country or working a lot or some family emergency.. don't ask to see items, etc.. sight unseen pay for them... and send a check and give overpayment to movers, yadda yadda.

&amp;#x200b;

now part of the reason i didn't figure this out is that the original emails said nothing about an overpayment until after i got the check and emailed the person back and mentioned that it was too much. i also assumed that today, 2020.. when i put the check in, banks would be able to validate/verify it is legit, company and bank, accounts, etc.. are all legit.. money is in the account attached to check, etc. i would assume this would be happening today. 

apparently i am wrong on that.. and it still takes up to two weeks for checks to fully clear..but banks still today allow you to take the money out and spend it.. and possibly give some of it to the ""movers"" or fake online account, etc... and then it bounces later, and you get screwed out of the money you paid out.. plus bounce check fees, etc.

&amp;#x200b;

ok.. so now i figured out this is a scam.  i put the check in..but did not yet withdraw money.. and mentioned to the person that the bank says it will take a few weeks to clear.. once it clears i'll let you know and arrange for pickup and all that.

i am not worried about the money.. i didn't take any out or spend it.. and i am calling fraud line tomorrow (tried today..they were closed). 

what i am most worried about is the person has my actual address info, name, mobile phone, etc. plus looking up my name (and city i live in) shows a picture of me as well. soo.. are these sorts of scams ever associated with anything physical/drastic happening.. e.g. people actually showing up, breaking in to steal other stuff.. or possibly.. worse.. actual harm to people in the cases someone like me is stupid enough to cough up my home address? or.. and what i am hoping for is most are fly by the night pos in some third world country trying to make a quick buck, but have got some updated/sophisticated ""automated"" shit in place to print checks, mail them out, etc.. all to try to make money off of someone and get away with it? do movers actually show up? or is that just the initial talk.. and then they tell you to use western union (some of the stories i read said they do this)? my hope is that if i got back to the person and said check is cleared i have money.. the next response would be.. just send it by western union to my movers.. and they'll be by on such and such day.. and then in the end.. nobody shows up.. i sent money.. i still have my goods, but lost out on the money i sent.???"

"hcg “weigh loss” scam victim here english isn’t first language sorry if stuff don’t make sense. 
a little bit about myself. i’ve always been overweight since childhood (never obese or to the point to). and my parents, specially my father, as always been verbal about how against he is about it. always being forced into diets i can never complete after a months. some involving pills, teas, and the main event one hormonal injections. 
when i mean my father being verbal about my weight, i meant degrading me, insulting me... practically destroying my self esteem and anything about myself. not only that, my mom would join. both parents would physically and mentally abuse me. my weight was one of the subjects. i was also bullied at school and weight was a subject there too. 

to be specific my father was the one who bought into the whole diet plan. he believes any youtube video he comes across; those “prank” videos made for kids, eternal youth stuff, economy talking videos telling people what to invest on, etc. basically he’s ridiculously gullible. i am too to some extent... but it’s because of him i started the diet. he found out a random american lady in town was selling the hcg diet injections for “half the price”. i don’t remember how much but it was a lot, and he said he looked it up and the original price in euros was really high. at that time it just had come out. and so at age 15, for almost 3 months i was forced to inject every morning growth hormones aka human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg), meaning the hormone helps maintain the production of important hormones like progesterone and estrogen, which are essential for the development of the embryo and fetus. 

so during the first 2 months it was summer break. and if you didn’t know, hcg “diet” only allows you to consume 500 calories a day. so obviously i spent 2 months laying on a couch watching tv too weak to stand up sometimes. month no. 2 comes up. i’ve already lost 10kg, my father is really proud, but my period shows up purple. weird huh? but it’s not like i can rely on a doctor. why? the american lady who is selling us the injections is nothing less but a boutique owner... “you’re fine dear, it’s normal” she says. 
queue 3rd month, school starts. having access to junk food thanks to the school cafeteria and my cravings as stopped anything to do with following the 500 calorie daily intake. one day during that month i get my period and the worst, i mean the worst stomach cramps of my life happen at school. my mom is called in, and she and i go to my first visit to a gynecologist who immediately tells me to stop taking those injections. like i mentioned before, that diet was new back then. it wasn’t know as a scam until now, so the doctor mentioned that diet was only for adults not that it was bad. it was just bad for someone so young. 
we tell my dad about it later that day, and queue years of him not forgiving me for stopping that diet. saying the doctor is an idiot and my mom and i are idiots for believing her. money wasted, daughter? still fat. 
and so, since then i’ve had the worst period cramps in the world (for me), no more regularity, breast pains, excessive body pain, excessive bloating, and a lot of blood. i also remember a couple of episodes of vertigo on my last year in high school (this will be important later one). 

finally financial independence after graduating and getting my first job. what do i do? spend all i have on food, and most importantly junk food. going from slightly overweighted to overweight. still with same period problems and can’t handle stressful situations at all (i’ve always suffered from migraines from parents abuse and stress they gave me). can’t handle an important job so i start working for my parents and i still live with them, even more stress. 

at the age of 21 (one month before turning 22), a day before leaving for a trip i wake up with the entire world spinning. a vertigo episode. those two vertigo episodes i got in high school were very tame and when i told my mom about them she said it was nothing and to suck it up and walk to school that way. this time i can’t stop puking from the dizziness. it’s much, much worse. doctor doesn’t know what it is but at the end of that day i stopped having them with some medicine doctor prescribed, and i left the next day to my holiday. which i spent most of the time in bed in the hotel, had no appetite for anything. 

back home for months i got dizzy laying down in certain positions and always when standing up, even slowly. one time during yoga class couldn’t get up at all. every time i tried i’d black out until i payed down again and was fine. took half an hour to try and get up and leave. went with one of those doctors that check your nose and ears, but he didn’t know what’s up. he had theories but nothing. 
one day something else happened. during some intimacy my blood pressure spiked, ridiculously high. of all my years of having migraines, if you ever felt one. i’ve never felt anything so painful in my life. what hurt the most that night, was my mother’s not caring, i begged her to pick me up and take me to the hospital. and after yelling during an entire car ride. at least the hospital took me seriously. hypertension was the doctors diagnosis. 

so now, overweight, hypertension (take a pill every time blood pressure gets high), irregular painful periods, insecure, i am victim of the hcg scam diet. 

i only found out last year, thanks to another doctor (practices acupuncture stuff) confirmation of why i have so many issues with weight loss, blood pressure, why my body is irregular. yeah i have huge breaths, but also i have a belly like i’ve been pregnant before. and i’m having milk out of them. which is humiliating to share. he also mentioned how some organs might be overgrown, but i have not confirmed that with studies yet but i will admit it doesn’t feel weird. he said i took those injections the worst time to take them, right during development years. i walk funny cause my knees can’t handle my weight and it’s harder, even harder to loose weight. i think a have a couple other issues but i can’t keep track

i’m 24 now, thanks to my boyfriend’s love and support i have been trying harder to loose weight. past two months, with healthy eating and working out i’ve lost 8 kg. my health might be way better just by loosing weight but i have to wait and see. 

i wasn’t the only victim of this scam though. my dad’s friend also tried this diet at the same time i did. she was 50+. you know what hcg did to her? she had a tumor that grew too fast... guess what caused that. she’s in a better place now. 

so yeah, this shit isn’t funny. i might not be dead. but have i wished that many times. i know depression is another side effect but whatever. 
i have been crying for the past hour, it’s not easy to accept this body. it wasn’t easy to accept it growing up, so why would it be now? i am taking my time and learning to love myself and take care of myself. and i finally have someone who loves me for who i am, which is hard to understand. he’s ridiculously attractive (blue eyes, dark hair, athletic) and loves me just the way i am. asked me to keep trying, and think about being healthy and having a long, long life with him. i want nothing more. 

sorry if long. i had to vent."

"came here from anti-mlm with a little interaction from a company called “solfin” hi, guys! i’ve been on the job hunt for long enough now that i’ve begun getting the unsolicited emails with lucrative “job offers”. the anti-mlm sub has been a great resource, but this company, solfin, seems to be a new one and not an mlm so i thought i would post over here to raise awareness. this was my original post over there:

&gt; just started getting some very.. enthusiastic-yet-cryptic emails from an “anna poggi,” trying to get me onboard for... something. no meetings, no phone calls; this is probably the strangest solicitation i’ve gotten. has anybody else dealt with this one? claims to be a company in italy, looking to expand:

&gt;dear xxxxxx, 
i deem it is essential to remind you again that tomorrow you will be officially brought in to participate in our selection of personnel and all chances are that your interview will scheduled for tomorrow as well. all of these will help you absorb better what our company can offer you in terms of possible employment as well as we will be able to get to know you better. we are looking forward to seeing you tomorrow among our new employees and wish you best of luck! 
regards, 
anna poggi 
solfin 
multifunctional building

so, anna listed a phone number with an area code suspiciously close to my location here in the states; i decided to take her up on her half-hearted offer to answer any of my questions by phone. really, before anything else happened she wanted me to fill out a google document file with all of my personal information and an employment agreement. nothing horrible so far, they weren’t asking for my social security number or a blood type or anything immediately alarming, but i decided i would grill her a little to see exactly what the racket was.

the employment agreement lists 2 potential roles that they are trying to fill within the company, as they are claiming to be on the verge of opening domestic offices closeby. one of the roles had absolutely nothing to do with sales or marketing, but later in the document it was mentioned that i would receive a percentage commission on sales. this was literally the first question i had for her, and she immediately started describing the very normal and common scenario where i’d be receiving domestic checks that i’d cash using my personal bank account, and then sending to them. as you do.

so, there you go. solfin’s another one to add to the list. i did a little research and there is a very slight chance that a small company by that name does exist in italy, and i know that it is common for scammers to steal legit info from real organizations, so just be on the lookout for ms anna poggi, if you happen to get an exciting new job offer in the mail."
"jail dominican scam preying on grandparents my dad has a flip cell phone. he's older so really he just started even texting this year on his little phone. he texts his kids/grandkids everyday now and today he said he's glad he does because...

at first i think my dad is about to text me a joke. i reply with what and an lol and he replies they just called and they attempted to call back. i become concerned and call my dad and he gives me some details.

the caller said i got married or was at a wedding in the dr and i was driving and hit another car and my passenger in my car is dead and i am in jail.

they gave him a number to call. not certain if they called the number but my dad did say they spoke to someone else that sounded just like the first caller and somehow part of a conversation my step mom had with the caller she told them she didn't have any children. i was at work so couldn't get details and my dad has never been much of a phone talker or talker in general so sorry i can't sort out more about the scam. 

my dad said they did gave him a number to call.

everything was ok, and after the insurance coverage, i had a nice fat $5,000 for a 2 day stay.

not an issue, i required a service, agreed to use that service. so i paid it.

today i got a ""bill"" from a third party named ""united telemanagement service"" for ""telephone / television"" usage. 

totaling $8 for the 2 days + $2 for ""late fee"" (even though this is the first time i'm getting it)

now you might think ""only $10? you just paid $5k w/o blinking"".

no fuck that, i never requested this service and nor did i use it. i'm not paying for things i didnt use.

after calling said number what they told me was:

&gt; you could have declined this service

i was fentenyl'ed up after surgery so how could i decline anything?

after some back and forth arguing, they finally decided to waive it.

moral of the story? all ways argue. i'm willing to bet this company is propped up purely on the sheer # of people that just blindly pay the ""rental fee"" since its such a small number."

"what the heck is going on? pizza delivery scam? not sure what to think of this whole situation.

alright, so i'm a pizza delivery driver, and last night i took a delivery to someone named ""bob"" (not using real names). when i got to bob's address, there was a taxi waiting out front on the phone with their dispatcher. i asked what's up, and the driver told me the guy hadn't ordered a taxi. weird.

my ticket said to call when i got there, which is fairly normal. many people have dogs that go nuts at the doorbell/knocking and prefer to meet me out front. i get asked that a few times a week. so i call, and no one answers. starting to get weirder. i figure i might as well go ring and see what happens and a guy comes to the door, says his name is bob, and that he didn't order a pizza or a taxi. 

ok, so someone's messing with this guy. irritating, but not unheard of. as i'm about to turn and leave, the number on the ticket calls me back. i answer (on speaker) and bob immediately recognizes the caller as his friend ""john"". john tells bob (still on speaker) that he's been trying to get ahold of him all day, and was starting to get worried when he got a call saying bob missed his dr.'s appointment and then couldn't be reached. so he's been sending random deliveries to his house all day with the instructions 'call when there' in hopes someone actually would - i was apparently the first all day to do so. bob says he got a new # that morning and completely forgot his appointment. they exchange new contact info, and before i end the call (still on speaker on my phone, but phone has not left my hands) john says ""ok before they go, give this delivery driver $50"" and bob without hesitation opens his wallet and gives me $50. dude still doesn't want the pizza, so i get $50 and a pizza. really weird situation, but it had been a slow night and i'd just doubled my tips in one delivery and got free dinner. not complaining. it was a weird situation, but i think that's the end of it. 

however, i just received a call from john saying *he's* the one that's switched numbers now (and he was calling from a new #), and would it be possible for me to drive over and give it to bob? he even said he'd place another delivery. the implication was i'd get more money if i did this, but i told the guy i was at my second job and couldn't make it. he tried extremely hard to get me to commit, and i finally told him 'i may have time tonight' in order to end the conversation. i probably could've just hung up, but i'm honestly extremely curious about what the heck is going on here. 

kind of regretting not just hanging up now, since i've decided not to go, and just tell the guy my dog got hit by a car and i can't go anywhere if he calls me back (already blocked both numbers), but i'm absolutely dying to know if anyone can tell me what's going on here? this screams 'it's a scam' to me but i genuinely can't figure out how. i wasn't asked to go inside, wasn't asked for any sensitive info - including my name - and my phone never left my hands. the taxi was suspicious too, but they drove off as soon as bob confirmed he didn't want, need, or order it.

**some other info that might be relevant:** i use a google voice number to call deliveries when needed. so the calls go to my personal cell, but come from a separate number - guy doesn't have my cell # and i told him it was a driver work # since he thought he was calling the store location. i am also male and in my mid 20's, but due to a hormonal imbalance i'm pretty short (5'1) and regularly get read as either young (under age 16), a butch lesbian, or both. point being, i did think it could've been some sort of human trafficking thing and they were hoping for a female driver (hence the taxi) but while bob read me as male right off, taxi driver read me as young woman and made zero moves to get out of the car. it still could be, which is why they're trying to get me to go back, but why not go for it last night?

anyways, if anyone has any insight into what's going on, it would be much appreciated!"

 unless he give them not only my nudes but his as well. of course after he give in they keep asking for more and only told me after he lied to me and asked me for nudes ( i thought it was werid as he has never done anything like this before but i trusted him). i freaked out and told him he should know better as he a compter major and basically learns about scams on a daily basis. they stopped texting him after he refused to give them anymore nudes. his dad however got a call from a burner number that some how got traced to a landline in my home town. we tried to track it however you all know how hard it is to do that from a burner number.


i'm freaking out because i'm not even sure how this could ruin my life i'm also vary confused as to why they stopped attacking him and just wanted nudes and nothing else."

"i've noticed several craigslist room ads use almost the same language. this is odd and makes me believe this could be a scam. can i get your take please? so i'm looking at several craigslist rooms for rent as i'm likely moving to the city. i'm noticing that several of them use basically the same phrases. as in the exact same phrases. this strikes me as odd unless they were to be explicit about this (clear they had multiple listings). i know we share the english language and it's common to use phrases that others use...but this is odd to me.

the other thing that is odd is that they all responded to me. they all sound like people, too. they are really well written adds. but why would they use so much similar language? am i being paranoid or just cautious/smart?

my dad is elderly and lonely, it fits into the category of someone these scammers would target. 

the woman who is messaging him is called tatiana (i don't have a surname). she lives in dubai, runs her own business, is originally from russia and has told my dad she wants to move to rome with him. 

i've tried to talk sense into my dad and point out its a scam but he won't listen because i have no ""proof"". according to him she hasn't asked for money or anything from him yet. 

i'm not the greatest detective when it comes to these things so i was hoping someone here could help me out with the images i've attached of said ""woman"". maybe help locate where they are really from etc.

"sextortion advice alright here is the gist, this is advice for people who are stuck in the scam after having already given money  
i got rolled up in a sextortion situation, they had vids of me they were 'going' to send out. i panicked, it was 3 am, and i sent them $300 au within a day.  
here's the lesson i learnt from all that ladies n gents. they literally only have leverage over you if you allow them to have leverage over you  
it's exactly what i did, i made it seem like my life would be over, begged em, pleaded them and they used that as fuel for the cause.   
it was after i (somehow) slept that night that i realized what i had fallen for.  
the worst thing they can do is reveal your address, but that still gives them literally no positive outcome, not even satisfaction because you are one of the many people they try to scam.  they'll roll you over and move on unless you piss them off. don't go talking about how 'i can track your ip' or 'i recorded you as well'. that just pisses them off, and will make you less of a victim and more of an enemy, they've also heard all those reasons before.  
once that day went by, i sent the money online, and they just had to go pick it up, they promised to delete the video after (obviously not). so this is what i did, i knew if i took back the cash i sent them, they'd get pissed, and make me an enemy. so as sad as it freaking was, i had to give them the 300. the second i realized they received it i sent them something like this, 'alright you got what you wanted, you're 300 bucks richer and i'm wiser on the internet. delete the video if you want, i don't really care anymore, i don't talk to 99% of those people anyway. hope you have a good day'. instantly blocking them after the transaction will show you are still scared, and they will try for you again. by sending them something like that, you let them know that their leverage is gone, they have their money, and you are taking the piss. they'll back off and find someone new, you're nothing to them anymore once they've lost leverage. then proceed to block them on that email, delete the email address fully - make sure to take note of all subscriptions. de-activate any social media and wait a few weeks.   
the only thing that gives them leverage is your fear, not your video, everyone masturbates, but not everyone acts unashamed for it, and those are their targets.   
so to sum up, learn your lesson first and foremost, don't ever try to piss them off, because they've seen it all before, and don't let them control your fear, it's how they keep coming back  
they don't know your fb friends or insta friends etc, so they either send it to a stranger you haven't talked to in years or a friend that's understanding. that's it. they really got nothing on you, other than your fear.  
if you have already sent cash once or twice, let them know that you have an idgaf attitude, and that you don't care if the video goes out. in that case, they lost leverage and have no reason to go out of their way to ruin your life. just don't piss them off.  
this mistake should happen once and once only, so deal with it, move on, and never do it again, we all make mistakes, so the people that appreciate you would understand anyway.

take care out there lovelies"

"possible insurance scam? i was in a crash last year (my fault, i rear ended a stopped car after failing to stop) and no one was overtly hurt at first but now the driver is claiming over $20, 000 in doctor bills and a possible future surgery. they are trying to claim the full extent of my policy for these supposed costs and future costs.  an insurance agent showed up at my house without warning with documents to fill out asking for my social and banking number.  when i looked at some of the papers a bit closer i started noticing several details wrong.  for instance, my mothers name for the person who received the citation (i'm under her policy but received the citation myself). another instance is the witness, the only other person who could have been a witness was the cars' passenger and he is saying i was on my phone, which is not true (i keep it in my passenger seat while driving and told the state trooper that). is this normal or does it seem like a scam? i've never had to deal with anything like this before and my anxiety is so high i cant think too much about it without spiraling.  any advice or help would be much appreciated!"

"i've been receiving calls from an unusual number coming from outside the country and i can't find it from the country codes list so it's been 2 days already since i've been receiving calls from this number:

plus-one-five-one-two eight-six-five six-nine-seven-two

(sorry if the number has to be in words)

much  to my annoyance, the calls are made way too early in the day; the first  being 5:20 am gmt+8 and the second at 3:52 am gmt+8. and the other  annoyance is i can't find it from the list of calling country codes but  i'm assuming it's part of usa.

on  both times, i tried to answer the call but it drops just a few seconds  or milliseconds before i get to trigger answering the call.

i'm  pissed at how early these calls are being made but i don't want to jump  the gun and immediately block the number before figuring things out.

i tried calling the number just a few minutes ago and i heard things like:

""please hold while i try to connect you (plays some guitar music afterwards)""

""voicemail bla bla bla to 'air woody' (if i heard it right)""

tried searching air woody but sadly, i can't find any meaningful results about it.

"i think i identified a phone scam halfway through the call but might have shared some info i am an international students in the us and am about to graduate. this recruiter reached out to me on linkedin and seemed to be from a staffing company. the company had a good profile page on linkedin with around 80 employees. i replied that i am interested to know more about the opportunity. he then emailed me the job description and called me. 

but then during the call he talked about the position and asked info that he needed to complete my profile. he asked my date of birth (month and date), zip code which i found weird but still did share. 
he then asked if i was okay sharing the last 4 digits of social security and work authorization docs and that's when i started doubting and did not share either of those. i somehow wrapped up the call. 

i'm worried what can be done using my name, birthdate and pincode? even though i didn't share any payment info i went to the bank and changed security details etc as a precaution. our university has warned us about these scams and asked to not share your social security no. with anyone. but i didn't think the other items were really sensitive info.

"the ""say yes"" urban myth in the news  

boston (whdh) - the better business bureau is warning residents in massachusetts, maine, rhode island, and vermont of a telephone scam that has made a reappearance in the last month.

there have been numerous reports of the “can you hear me?” scam in the past two weeks, [according to the bbb scam tracker](https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker/us).

the bbb says it has tallied nearly 10,000 reports of this phishing scam throughout the united states and nearly 150 reports in massachusetts alone since 2017.

“the way it works is you’ll get a call from someone (many times automated) who tries to solicit you into saying ‘yes,’ typically by asking ‘can you hear me?’ they typically pretend to be with a company or department from an organization,” [the bbb wrote in a post on its website](https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/21489-scam-alert-can-you-hear-me-scam-calls-detected-in-massachusetts-vermont-rhode-island). “for example, one scammer in a recent report from massachusetts claimed to be from tripadvisor, another said they were part of the ‘rewards department.'”

"myus.com are a bunch of scammers once you add your credit card you can't remove it, anyway i wanted to buy a phone from ebay and have it shipped from me but then changed my mind, forgot to change the ebay address to my address instead of myus address, i bought something from china for half a dollar, tried to cancel it but couldn't, contacted myus several times and they all told me i should wait and cancel it when it arrives to myus and i got an email today that it arrived and i did just that, i went to their website and i cancelled it, it was cancelled, nowhere to be seen in history or anywhere, yet somehow they sent me an email that it was shipped and i was charged, if this is not a scam i don't know what is, i tried contacting them and they're trying to see if they can cancel the shipment. why do i have to go through all this trouble? fucking assholes i'm so mad. they ruined my day. please avoid using myus.com, i think their reviews online are probably mostly fake, they're an awful company. fuck scammers."

"tutanota phishing so i've had a few random emails from ""tutanota team"" saying i need to confirm or update my details and login credentials but considering it's a burner account i never bothered. 

i got another one today and actually decided to read it this time and there were red flags all over the place. the email address was wrong. there were spelling, formatting and grammar mistakes. then there was this suspicious button at the bottom. 

checking the link location shows it was a bitly address and using a url extender showed some weird address from the domain ""theamazingtravelclub"" dot com. clicking the link takes you to a copy of the tutanota login page with that travel club domain instead of the normal tutanota one. it accepts any email address and redirects you to the actual tutanota login page after you attempt to login from the fake one. 

checking the homepage of the domain leads to a pretty barren looking site which is supposedly a travel site but doing a talos check on it shows it comes under the pr0n0graffy content type. the ""contact us"" page leads to even more questions because the contact form has been disabled because of abuse by someone whose email address they listed, as well as a contact address for the travel club.

i tested a few different variations of the full link from the button in the email and one led me to a login page which i haven't been able to get through. 

 if anyone can help me make sense of any of this it would be greatly appreciated.

the amount of effort they’ve put into the entire thing is incredible. i’m still questioning if they’re real and i’m just being too cynical. 

first off all, no language or grammar mistakes!!

the pay for position was an appropriate amount. 
they have a real office space listed as their head office. 
they have a real website which looks very professional. 
they have a real person’s name and signature as their ceo on the employment papers. 
they have a real, fully legally compliant employment contract. 
 

why i think it’s a scam?

well, i was approached for a position that i haven’t worked but i’ve worked a similar department. 

the talent acquisition is a dead person (unverified, but given everything google says she dead). 

they offered me the pay of someone with 5+ years of experience. 

they’re employment process is super easy (sign the contract and show up to work). 

they want me to take a photo of myself holding the signed contract. 

nothing about this company comes up on any social media platform or any search results, except for the website they’ve given.

"i’m in the midst of a craigslist rental scam...need revenge advice craigslist apt scam

i’ve been looking for rental homes on craigslist for my girlfriend and i in los angeles. came across a beautiful home and reached out. the next day, i received the following email:

“thanks for your interest in my property and i apologize for the late response. i’m a larry (last name redacted because i think the scammer used some poor old guy’s name who has nothing to do with the scam) and i own this property. i received your message and i appreciate the response to my ad on the rental website. the property is still available and move-in ready and we'll be renting it out to any reliable tenant. 

at the moment i won't be able to show the house to you in person and walk you through it as i already left for detroit mi due to family emergencies and business purposes.

the house viewing session was also completed last week and i was on the property myself handing out applications to interested applicants like you, walking them through the home and discussing the requirements involved in qualifying to rent it. but you can drive by anytime to view the exterior part of the property or look through the windows if you want to view some part of the interior and get back to me if satisfied.  

i can also have the house secured for you if you are seriously interested and also i can set up an application from here (no application fee)

the property is well maintained  and equipped with new range / oven, refrigerator, washer, dryer.”

i quickly replied as the house was great and the price was cheap, but not insanely cheap. i said i’d go check it out but would like to submit an application in the mean time. in the responses, i received an application form and encouragement to go peek in the windows to make sure the property was to my likening. 

i did a quick search of larry’s name and it said he was the 67 year old owner of the address (i had only searched the individuals name, nothing to do with the address) so it was good enough for me - really just focused and wanting the house.

i fill out the janky / basic application form (which looked like an old man made in word so i believed it). it asked for full name, address, drivers license number, previous address, reference, pet information, etc all pretty normal stuff. i emailed it back, expressing further interest in the house. i got a reply i would hear back the next day (today).

for some reason, start thinking something is off after i hit send on the application email. i go back to the craigslist post and it’s been flagged for removal. i find the house listed on zillow for twice as much and call the realtor connected with the listing. she said they never listed it for that price and never on craigslist.

i’m pissed at myself for being so naive. i immediately put fraud alerts and freezes on my credit.

i wake up this morning to a text from “larry” and saying he’s reaching out about my application. for the hell of it (i suppose i don’t want them to know i know yet) i reply and get an immediate call. i answer with “hello.” silence. “hello.” more silence. i hang up and this happens again. i call the number and a deep voice claiming to be larry starts speaking and asking if my visit to the property went well. i hang up, unsure what my next move will be. certainly they will be asking for a deposit. i look up the number and it’s a google voice number out of nevada.

tldr i’ve essentially (and stupidly) fallen pray to an craigslist home rental scam. they have a rental application from me with basic information such as full name, address, past address and drivers license number. all i have as contact is a generic gmail address and a google voice number. i have frozen my credit as well as applied fraud alerts. i have not sent any money.

are there any savvy ways of getting back at them or exposing the scammers in this case? at least, should i provide them with inaccurate or bogus information on me to sour the information from the application they already have on me? i want to fuck these guys up - help!"

"i can’t figure out if this is a scam or what. someone signed up for three restaurants’ loyalty programs under my email. so last night in the space of three hours, i got emails from three different restaurants congratulating me for joining their loyalty/rewards programs. i have never been to any of these restaurants: native grill and wings, farmerboys, and moe’s southwest grill. one had the name as seinfeld howard and the other as john. neither are my name. 

as far as i can tell, no one has accessed my email. no logins but me and i just changed the password a few days ago by coincidence. and it doesn’t appear that they had to confirm the email to sign up (it looks like it was all done via their apps). 

just for shits and giggles, i went to moe’s website (not by clicking anything in the emails of course) and requested a password reset just to see if i’d be able to change it. it did and gave me access to the account. looked like they got a free cup of queso for signing up although i couldn’t tell if they’d claimed it. 

is this a scam? is some lazy asshole just using my email that they found somewhere on the internet to sign up for multiple loyalty rewards? or is something else going on here that i’m not seeing?

if it is something like that, these damn app developers need to make you actually confirm the account via email before letting you sign up."

ich werde auch eine immobilie für meine privaten zwecke benötigen, da ich wegen meiner pensionierung in ihr land ziehen werde. deshalb habe ich sie kontaktiert, damit wir gemeinsam meinen plan aufstellen können, in ihr land zu investieren. infolgedessen ist es mir wichtig, ihnen mitzuteilen, dass ich einen betrag von 5,2 mio. eur in meinem besitz habe. das habe ich während unserer razzia gegen den terrorismus in kabul, afghanistan, bekommen. und sobald ich von ihnen höre, dass sie mir helfen können, werde ich mich für die lieferung melden.  


ich habe dieses geld an einem sehr sicheren ort in unserem lager in kabul, afghanistan, aufbewahrt und warte auf einen moment wie diesen, um das geld sinnvoll zu nutzen. jetzt möchte ich, dass die kiste unverzüglich bewegt wird. ich habe sehr profitable investitionspläne zur hand. ich kann dieses geld nicht in die vereinigten staaten überweisen, weil ich ungefähr 5 jahre in ihrem land sein werde, also brauche ich jemanden, dem ich vertrauen kann. wenn sie zustimmen, überweise ich das geld an ihr land, in dem sie der begünstigte sind, da ich derzeit einige punkte mit dem fünfeck abrechne. daher kann ich einen solchen betrag nicht vorführen, sodass ich jemanden als begünstigten vorstellen muss amerikaner und ein geheimdienstoffizier dafür, damit ich ein 100% authentisches mittel habe, um das geld durch einen diplomatischen kurierdienst von hier weg zu überweisen. ich brauche nur deine zustimmung und alles ist erledigt.  


wenn sie interessiert sind, mir bei dieser transaktion zu helfen, gebe ich ihnen die vollständigen details, die sie benötigen, damit wir diese transaktion erfolgreich durchführen können. ich habe mich entschlossen, jemanden zu finden, der real und nicht imaginär ist, und deshalb bin ich zu einer gesicherten site gegangen, wo ich sicher sein kann, dass die person real ist. ich glaube, ich kann dir vertrauen. im moment gehe ich sehr vorsichtig mit der art und weise um, wie ich kommuniziere, um jegliches risiko zu vermeiden, bis dieses geld endlich in ihrer obhut ist. ich werde ihnen per e-mail mitteilen und sie auch anrufen, wenn es notwendig ist, sie über wichtige informationen zu informieren. ich möchte, dass du mutig bist, da ich alles unter kontrolle habe. ich habe jeden beweis für diesen fonds in meinem besitz, um ihnen zu zeigen, dass alles authentisch ist.  


wenn sie nicht interessiert sind, antworten sie nicht auf diese e-mail und löschen sie diese nachricht. wenn sie nach 3 tagen keine antwort erhalten, suche ich nach einer anderen person. ich mache das auf vertrauen, also möchte ich, dass sie jegliche gier oder den gedanken an betrug beiseite lassen, da wir in dieser geschäftsbeziehung viel zu gewinnen haben. 5,2 millionen euro sind eine menge geld, von der jeder träumt. ich bin gerade in afghanistan und muss dieses geld sichern und an sie senden, wenn wir eine ordnungsgemäße einigung erzielen. ich schreibe ihnen von einer neuen privaten e-mail-adresse, bitte löschen sie diese nachricht, wenn sie nicht an einer zusammenarbeit mit mir interessiert sind.  


ich warte auf ihre kontaktdaten, damit wir weitermachen können. in weniger als 5 tagen sollte der fonds an sie überwiesen worden sein und ich werde für mein geld vorbeikommen. ich werde ihnen 20% der summe geben und 80% ist für mich. ich hoffe, dass ich in dieser sache fair bin.

"i'm not 100% sure this is a scam, but it seems very fishy so i figured i would ask. if this type of post isn't allowed here please delete it an accept my apologies.

so, here's the story:

my partner received and email at 1705 today from a local restaurant confirming a reservation for two people for dinner on valentine's evening. she, excitedly, asked if i booked dinner under her name and email. she was a little deflated when i said no and looked confused, but then we wondered who the hell had.

we looked over the email (without touching anything) and it looks pretty legit. her email, her phone number, her full name, a google map showing us the location of the restaurant. 

we didn't want to use the email or phone number provided on the email to cancel, so we googled the businesses details, which matched that of the email.

we called the restaurant and asked if they had a booking for *partner's name* for valentine's day and they said no. we asked if they could check the system using her email address. nothing. then we noticed a confirmation number on the email which we gave to the girl. she said she would call us back in a minute to confirm?

waited about 5 min and got a call back saying there was a booking at the restaurant. the girl queried my partner wondering if it was me who booked for her (being valentine's day) but i can confirm it wasn't. the girl had no details about who could have booked this reservation... so we just had to leave it.

we message our families asking if anyone had made the booking... just in case... but no one has.

we're left in the dark as to what has happened here?

i'm worried this is some insane complex scam that i'm too dimwitted to understand. has anyone got any idea? or is this just a system glitch?

thank you for any advice."

first of all, it was sent to my address, but they didn't use my name, they used community org (i do not want to share the specific community name for anonymity). i used this community org to help me file my taxes in the past. 

the text of the letter is as follows: 
""tenant lease security welcome notice

jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. is pleased to notify that your tenant security deposit, defined in appropriate boxes on this form, is maintained at this bank in an interest bearing account."" 

they list the deposit date as recent, i did not recently move into a new place and the security amount is way more than my current rent (almost $5k).

"bank phone number spoof scam well, it happened to me and i’m honestly so happy i follow this subreddit. obligatory “i’m on mobile” apology. 

today i received several phone calls in quick succession from a 800 phone number that i didn’t recognize. i didn’t answer. i then received a text suggesting that it was from my bank fraud department and they had found suspicious activity. 

the phone number then called again and i answered. 
they asked if i was “saltiestteacher” and i replied yes. i immediately felt weird because my small town bank doesn’t currently to my knowledge have employees with the accent this person had, but i didn’t want to assume so i said nothing. 

they asked if i was in tennessee and i stupidly said, no i’m in “x-city” where i live. they ended up using that info later in the call. 
they said they were cancelling the card and sending a new one, then asked if i’m still at the “x-city address” which i replied yes. 

they then asked if i can still be reached at “xxx-xxx-xxxx” phone number which i said yes. and to “verify my identity” they asked the “which address have you been associated with” question, the first of which had a full address, the second two only being cities. this is where i thought to myself, am i really being scammed right now?

i told this caller that i was going to hang up and call the bank back and ask for the fraud department. that i felt uncomfortable and i knew sometimes scams pretended to be banks. he said “well you can check the back of your card and see that it’s the same phone number” that’s when i knew. i said “scammers can spoof phone numbers”

y’all. he hung up on me. 

i immediately called my bank and described my situation. apparently i was not the first person to call with this same scam today, but i was the first to not be tricked answering the security personal info questions. 

apparently, they already had my card number because i had a fraudulent $.01 charge pending on my bank account. they called to get more information so they could transfer more. 

this story ends happy, i canceled my card and will go pick up a new one tomorrow. my bank told me the way they handle fraud alerts so i will know next time faster and not give any information at all. 

kudos to my bank and thank you r/scams for making me more aware!"
"unusual phishing email recently i had several things occur that i think need attention. first, i was prompted by twitter and reddit that my password needed to be changed because of suspicious activity. then my netflix was accessed in eastern europe and morocco. then i got this phishing email that wasn’t caught in spam that i’ve never seen in my regular email. it had a company on it that i did business with but i clicked the link it was fraudulent. was my identity stolen?"

voy a usar todos los datos porque tampoco creo que se merezcan el anonimato.

todo empieza por una conversación en instagram pidiendo ayuda (@mary\_taylor333), ya que estoy bastante metido en el tema, de que no saben como acceder a una cartera que le ha dado un amigo. parece bastante preocupado y yo siendo buena persona decido ayudar. no sé como me acaba pasando los credenciales diciendo que como igualmente no va a saber entrar y manejarlo que si quiero que le pase lo que haya de dinero o que me lo quede porque tampoco lo iba a usar.

entro en la cuenta y me encuentro la friolera de 3.9 btc, que vienen a ser siendo 40000 dolares, al ser estudiante y pasar del aire me sorprendí bastante pero no iba a engañar a nadie así que le pedí el paypal para mandarle todo el dinero en cuento lo hubiese recuperado. al ir a retirar los fondos me daba error, que debía hacerlo con su propia aplicación(no uséis esta extensión de google, permite hacer transacciones sin autorización)

"job interview offer scam? recently i uploaded my resume to my university job site, and i got a text with an area code from canada today saying my resume was pulled from there and approved for an online interview with ktc group pte ltd (searching this brings up a construction company from singapore? i am from the us btw). i responded asking for more information about the company and positions and was given a list of positions which were supposedly available in my area for $30/hour.

&amp;#x200b;

i also received instructions to download an app called telegram (looks like some sort of secure messaging service in the vein of whatsapp), and to link my gmail and message their hr manager whose number they provided. these texts were also sent practically the moment after i first replied, which makes me suspect they were sent automatically.

why would i need to do all this communicating through text and messaging apps instead of through email? am i correct in suspecting this as the beginning of a scam attempt?"

"weird phonecall possible scam? hiya, i just wanted to double check something.

i got a phone call and i screened it a couple times, but on the third time i picked it up since i figured it was someone actually wanting to get in contact with me :/ 

i waited for the other person to talk and they said
 ""hello? i'm looking for 'my real name'""
i responded ""how can i help you?""
in which they immediately hung up.

now i don't know if it's possibly a scam to confirm whether or not my name is tied to this phone number, but i wanted to see what y'all thought and if i should take some precautions for what may or may not come from this.
(definitely still kicking myself for even picking it up oh well)

tldr; got called multiple times, picked up phone, voice on the other line asked for my real name, i replied how can i help, and was promptly hung up on."

"is my friend a part of an elaborate mlm scheme? i could be being overly suspicious here but he is my friend and i want to make sure he is okay.

my friend is doing an online marketing course where has 2 mentors. my friends job is to advertise the knowledge these mentors have to others. apparently they give you training in how to get other students to sign up, and when they do you get 75% of what this student pays in.

my friend has paid £2000 to do the course as an inner circle member and then £70 monthly. he has weekly skype calls with his mentors who teach him how to advertise and sell the knowledge they have. my friend has created a webpage and an instagram for this where he posts photos of amazing cars (that aren't his) and inspirational quotes. 

his mentors appear extremely rich on their instagrams. my friend has met them in person once where they took photos of him in their cars for my friend to post online. 

when i asked him what he gets in return for this money he says he gets lessons on how to develop his online presence.

it sort of sounds like an mlm but i'm not sure? maybe i am suspicious because i don't personally understand it. he's invested a lot of money and he tells me he should be able to do this full time by summer. he says other students like him make *thousands* every month, but that would entail getting over 5 new students every month. that doesn't add up to me.

is this legitimate?"
nice try

"advice on what can i do after being scammed (received different item than the listed one) hey all,

shortly what the title says...

any help is appreciated.

backstory:

i'm from croatia, we have here something called njuskalo ([https://www.njuskalo.hr/](https://www.njuskalo.hr/)), it's basically craigslist for croatia, anyone can list items for sale. i found a laptop i wanted (lenovo legion y530, i7-8750h, gtx 1060, 16gb ram, 256gb ssd, 1tb hdd, 144hz 16"" screen and \~2 and a half years warranty) and the price wasn't that low so i didn't think it might be scam (6000hrk \~ 890usd). my brother was going today in the city where seller is (zagreb, capital of croatia) so yesterday i contacted seller would he be able to meet him today so he checks the laptop and make a deal if possible.

they met near the train station so i don't even know if the guy is from zagreb as his profile states. he handed my brother the warranty paper with all the specifications as listed above so i guess my brother didn't pay much attention to the laptop itself. he checked that it was indeed the same model (legion y530) and he saw it was the same processor and gtx 10 series graphics card. he was convinced so he paid him and left for his car (it was raining heavily). i told him to check dxdiag (tools in windows to easily check specification) so when he came to his car he sent me pictures of warranty paper and checked dxdiag.

the difference is that it has 8gb of ram, gtx 1050 gpu (75% slower than 1060 according to [https://www.game-debate.com/gpu/index.php?gid=3541&amp;gid2=3540&amp;compare=nvidia%20geforce%20gtx%201050-vs-nvidia%20geforce%20gtx%201060](https://www.game-debate.com/gpu/index.php?gid=3541&amp;gid2=3540&amp;compare=nvidia%20geforce%20gtx%201050-vs-nvidia%20geforce%20gtx%201060)), 128gb ssd and 60hz screen. the warranty paper is from a different laptop which meant the laptop has no warranty as well. it's not a bad laptop but it's not the desired one, and for the money i paid i could have found better one.

my brother tried going to the seller's location but it's an apartment building and i don't have the name of the seller, just his nickname on njuskalo and his mobile phone number which he doesn't answer.

at the moment i started writing this my brother was going to police station to file a report but i doubt that will have any success.

what are my options? is there anything i can do?"

"just doing my legwork in case this turns into a scam. i've been talking with a girl from a dating site for a few days and she just said that she's too busy to talk because her car was just stolen. she didn't ask for money or anything (yet), i'm just curious if anyone knows of something trickier than that. if there's another level of complexity i want to be prepared for it.  or maybe the poor girl just had her car stolen, i don't know, but it's a little odd. thanks for any advice you might have, obviously i'm not going to give her money or let her borrow my car or anything."

"the once in a life time antique art find!! can’t miss this!! so i deal in a very specific and niche type of rare vintage art, actively buying, selling and writing about this stuff. at times i am looking for specific pieces. 
i reached out to someone, we will call him jack, to see if he knew where two specific pieces were because i know that he knows where some things are. keep in mind i don’t know this guy well. have only talked to him over text once or twice. however i have heard lots of things about him like he lies perpetually. 
instead of responding to my original question he boasts about buying a treasure trove of these pieces. too many to seem real. red flag 1. however my imagination and want to see this stuff goes wild and i ask what’s going to come of it or if i can buy any of it. he said he’s putting up a museum in the “geo hub” of this type of art. not only did he buy that massive amount of art but also several other one of a kind artifacts that are sort of related but i didn’t care about. 

just as a way to get access to seeing the stuff i said when you get it all, if you need help with the museum let me know! he said yes call me any time. i said i’d call him monday after getting back from a family trip to x state. he asks where in x state i’m going, what do you know, that’s where he’s buying all this stuff, this sunday!! he says you must come see the stuff and be a part of this. i say i’d have to change my return flight as i would leave in the morning that day. he said oh it can’t be much to change it!! he gives me all the details of this meetup and plan, also who else will be there, a lot of code names or nicknames too which i found weird. so i look into it and using one of those credit card statement signup bs things i get the new return flight at 7pm for like $35. i’m happy, get to see this once in a life time thing and didn’t cost me much as i was already going there anyways with family. 

the family vacation goes well, saturday i call him and ask when we are meeting tomorrow. he says oh shoot i’ve been so busy i haven’t set up a time, i’ll call the seller now and find out what time and where and call you right back, but it’ll be 10-11am when we meet. didn’t hear back from him until 9:40am sunday. 

at this point i’m pretty annoyed because if i had gone to the airport then, i could have made my original morning flight then. however he gives me the sellers phone number and said in an hour, call them and find out where and when and let me know. i go have breakfast at the hotel room and check out. call the seller, his wife answers, no clue what’s going on. she heard rumblings if possibly meeting with jack today but said no one was going to be able to see anything today and she didn’t know where her husband was. i say ok i’ll call jack and see what’s going on. jack says “oh don’t worry she’s going to call me back and let me know! the seller told me next time you’re in the area call me!!” red flag 2. then red flag 3 hit me right in the face. i ask jack “what should i do now because i’m just sitting here in the hotel lobby without a room...??” he proceeded to start screaming at me over the phone saying it’s not his fault i have to catch a flight (at 7pm, current time was 11am) and how he’s been working non stop on this deal and several other things and he can’t keep track of everyone and make the plans. then he starts bashing people i know, that have nothing to do with any of this. that was literally a 15-20 minute rant of him yelling at me and i just listened to see how psycho this guy really was. at the end i said ok i’ll wait for you to hear from them and you let me know. 

i called the sellers wife again and apologized for the misunderstanding and that i was led to believe other things were going on and there were definitive plans and such to see this stuff. she still was clueless and couldn’t find her husband but was very nice and said to come back another time to see everything, which isn’t as much as i was told. 

so i head to the airport and arrive just after my original flight left. try to find an earlier flight, all booked. so i waited in the airport from 11:30-7pm. didn’t get home until 2:30am. i was pissed. jack messaged me that night asking if i ever heard back from the seller and i said no, he hadn’t either. he then tells me someone in our circles told him that i have a lot of money. not that it was needed anymore but that was red flag 4-8. turns out this person didn’t mention me to jack at all, i verified that through 3 people. he was just baiting me to say “yup i’m loaded, come rip me off” 

so not only did he make up this invitation and visit to see this collection that he has no way to actually buy because he’s broke, he was trying to find a way to rip me off through this and get me to find out where the collection was. thank god i realized that at 11 sunday and it only cost me a day +$35 for the extra flight. i found out after from several people that jack has swindled and ripped off many people in the past both successfully and unsuccessfully. i also found out the seller is the same type of evil and does have stuff but condition is poor and he is massively hard to deal with. so it’s safe to say i’m done dealing with these idiots."

"i'm going to jail (short) first time poster, but just a quick one i had to share

just sitting, studying, minding my own business, then get a call from an obvious fake number (started 020)

being the curious person i am i picked up to be greeted by a robot voice. who proceeded to tell me that he was from hm revenue &amp; customs.

he asked me to press 1 to talk to an agent about an outstanding something (i was thinking it was about a package i'd ordered). and if i did not press one, then a warrant for my arrest would be issued.

ah, that's interesting, i almost pressed one, until i actually used my brain and realized that this was a scam, what police officer would require me to talk to them like it's tech support and if i don't they'll arrest me.

unless it wasn't, to which i'm hoping there's reddit in jail"
"i would like some assistance about something on facebook. so i got a message yesterday from a facebook friend on messenger about a winnings from facebook user reward. i am just concerned about being scammed and was wondering, what do you think about it?
